I hope my further comments herein will help to inform your analysis of my input to the game.","Simply, after receiving a positive score, I continued with the current partner for the next score; but after any negative score I immediately switched to a different partner.  (Note: After getting a negative score and therefore switching from one partner to another, if I then immediately received another negative score, then I'd usually switch to the remaining least-recently-used partner.) ... (Note: I didn't hold any specific bias toward or against any partner, at least not consciously.  See my further comments for more about that.)","No, I didn't change my strategy very much or very significantly.  From the first half of the partner game to the second half,  there may have been some inconsistency in how I chose which other partner to try next when switching; but admittedly I wasn't trying to be very systematic about that.  I did eventually begin to think about modifying my strategy, but I wasn't aware of enough information to motivate a specific change. ... Eventually I became aware of some possibility that perhaps the middle partner might have given a higher frequency or percentage of negative scores than the others. But admittedly I wasn't tracking the scores carefully enough to be sure about that.  So I didn't modify my behavior based on that; at least not consciously. ... (Let's suppose, just hypothetically, if I had opted to track the scores more carefully than I actually did, and suppose if I had confirmed some pattern that could fault one of the partners, might I then have been more likely to revise my strategy to disfavor that partner? Perhaps, but still I would've hesitated to change, because I don't necessarily trust past performance as an indicator of future results. Considering the limited length of the game, admittedly I didn't feel sufficiently motivated to track results very carefully or to attempt much of an analysis; and even if I had, I probably would've maintained my simple strategy without much change.) ... (Addendum: Although I've noted a possibility that one partner might've given negative scores more frequently than the others, I've also noted that I wasn't really sure about that; so, on a presumption of innocence without definite proof of guilt, I'll indicate ""Probably not"" on the question of whether a partner attempted any ""deliberate sabotage"".)",-3,It was an interesting game and survey.
