Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows an understanding of the task's feedback mechanism (positive and negative scores) and the need to adapt to changes, indicating a moderate to good comprehension. The response suggests they grasped the task's dynamic nature but lacks explicit mention of overall goals or rules.
- **Judgment**: The participant describes a basic strategy of testing and retesting individuals based on the feedback received, which shows some planning and hypothesis formation. The strategy is somewhat simplistic but indicates a methodical approach.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by indicating a willingness to switch after negative feedback, showing some evaluation. However, the depth of this reflection is limited, as there is no detailed analysis of why the strategy might work or fail.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy of sticking with a choice until it fails multiple times. This shows a clear strategy, though it's not highly sophisticated.
- **Confidence**: The participant does not express strong certainty or doubt about their approach. The use of phrases like ""Not really"" suggests some uncertainty, but there is no strong expression of confidence or self-doubt, leading to a middle-range score."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant seems to have a basic understanding of the task as they describe sticking with a choice until it becomes less beneficial. However, the explanation lacks depth regarding the overall goal or rules of the task, suggesting a score leaning towards ""Adequate.""

**Judgment:** The participant outlines a strategy of sticking with a choice until it proves less beneficial, indicating some form of planning or hypothesis. This shows more than rudimentary understanding but lacks sophisticated insight into strategic variability or adaptability, fitting an ""Adequate"" to ""Good"" range.

**Evaluation:** The participant mentions switching when a choice starts ""losing me a greater amount,"" which shows some reflection on the strategy's effectiveness. However, the reflection on why this strategy worked or didn't is minimal, suggesting a score around ""Adequate.""

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule of staying with a choice until it becomes less beneficial and then switching. This indicates some clarity in decision-making strategy, aligning with a ""Good"" score, though not fully sophisticated or deeply reasoned.

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their strategy. The brief and somewhat unclear response suggests uncertainty, fitting a score around ""Adequate."" The lack of strong confidence or self-assurance in their reflection supports this estimation."

Rationale: The participant's reflection is extremely brief and lacks depth across all dimensions. The response ""No ; Only choosing a different person."" does not clearly address the reflection questions regarding strategy use or changes in strategy during the task. 

- **Comprehension**: The response does not demonstrate an understanding of the task rules, structure, or goal. The probability is high (0.8) that the comprehension is absent.
- **Judgment**: There is no clear evidence of forming a hypothesis or plan about how to act, leading to a high probability (0.8) of absence in this dimension.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not reflect on whether their strategy worked or why, which suggests a high probability (0.9) of absence in evaluation.
- **Final Decision**: The response does not describe a consistent rule or decision strategy, indicating a high probability (0.8) that this dimension is absent.
- **Confidence**: The participant does not express certainty or doubt about their approach or understanding, leading to a high probability (0.7) of absence in expressing confidence.

**Rationale:**  
The participant's reflection, ""nothing to strategy ; no strategy"", provides minimal insight into their understanding or approach to the task. This response suggests a lack of engagement with the task's strategic elements, leading to high probabilities of scoring low across all dimensions.

- **Comprehension:** The participant does not demonstrate an understanding of the task rules, structure, or goal, as they claim to have used ""no strategy."" This suggests a lack of comprehension or a disregard for the task's requirements.
- **Judgment:** The statement implies no hypothesis or plan was formed, as the participant explicitly states there was ""no strategy.""
- **Evaluation:** There is no reflection on whether a strategy worked or why, as the participant indicates they did not employ any strategy.
- **Final Decision:** The participant does not describe any consistent rule or decision strategy, reinforcing the notion of ""no strategy.""
- **Confidence:** The participant's brief response does not explicitly express certainty or doubt about their approach; however, the assertion of having ""no strategy"" might imply a certain level of confidence or resignation about this approach.

Given the brevity and content of the reflection, the probabilities are skewed towards lower scores, reflecting the absence of detailed metacognitive engagement with the task."

- **Comprehension**: The participant's statement ""Just rotated around seeing which was beneficial"" suggests a rudimentary understanding of the task's goal (to find beneficial choices), but lacks depth or clarity about the structure or rules, hence a high probability for a score of 1.
- **Judgment**: The participant indicates a basic strategy (""rotated around"") which shows some planning or hypothesis about how to act, but it's not detailed or sophisticated, leading to a higher probability for a score of 2.
- **Evaluation**: The reflection lacks any substantive evaluation of whether the strategy worked or why, leading to a high probability for a score of 0.
- **Final Decision**: The participant's response indicates they did not switch strategies, suggesting a consistent but not necessarily effective or reflective decision strategy, hence a high probability for a score of 2.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief and vague response does not clearly express certainty or doubt about their approach, suggesting a higher probability for lower scores in this dimension."

- **Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's reward mechanism by focusing on the amount of money and responding to it. However, the reflection lacks depth about the overall structure or goal of the task, suggesting a score leaning towards ""Adequate.""
- **Judgment:** The participant indicates a simple strategy based on the observed reward, which reflects some planning or hypothesis formation about how to act. The response suggests a moderate level of judgment, leaning towards ""Good.""
- **Evaluation:** The participant does not reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy or why it might have worked or not, indicating a high probability of an ""Absent"" score in this dimension.
- **Final Decision:** The participant's strategy seems consistent, as indicated by repeatedly hitting the same button when seeing the amount of money. This suggests a clearer rule or decision strategy, leaning towards ""Good"" or ""Exemplary.""
- **Confidence:** The participant's brief and straightforward response does not explicitly express confidence or doubt, but the simplicity and directness might imply some level of confidence in their approach, leaning towards ""Good."""

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant's reflection shows a basic understanding of the task's feedback mechanism (negative value leads to a strategy change). However, the explanation lacks depth about the overall task structure or goals, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.

**Judgment:**  
The participant indicates a clear plan or hypothesis (switching choices upon receiving a negative outcome), which shows some strategic thinking. The reflection suggests a moderate level of planning, leaning towards a ""Good"" score.

**Evaluation:**  
The participant implicitly reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by sticking to it throughout, suggesting it worked for them. This indicates a good level of self-assessment, thus a higher probability for a ""Good"" score.

**Final Decision:**  
The participant explicitly states they did not change their strategy (""no, stayed the same""), indicating a very strong adherence to their chosen approach. This clarity and consistency in their decision-making process justify a high probability for an ""Exemplary"" score.

**Confidence:**  
The participant's brief response does not explicitly state confidence, but the decision to stick with a single strategy throughout the task suggests a high level of confidence in their chosen method. This is reflected in the higher probabilities for ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"" scores."

**Rationale:**  
The participant's reflection, ""I guessed ; No,"" provides minimal insight into their metacognitive processes during the task. The response is extremely brief and lacks depth across all dimensions of the Metacognitive Prompting framework.

- **Comprehension:** The participant does not demonstrate an understanding of the task rules, structure, or goal. The use of ""guessed"" suggests a lack of engagement with the task's requirements, leading to a high probability of a score of 0.
- **Judgment:** There is no evidence of forming a hypothesis or plan about how to act, other than random guessing. This indicates a lack of strategic thinking or planning, justifying a high probability of a score of 0.
- **Evaluation:** The participant does not reflect on whether their strategy worked or why, which is critical for this dimension. The absence of any evaluative comments supports a high probability of a score of 0.
- **Final Decision:** The participant does not describe any consistent rule or decision strategy they ultimately applied. The response ""No"" to changing strategies does not provide information about any decision-making process, leading to a high probability of a score of 0.
- **Confidence:** The participant's brief response does not express any certainty or doubt about their approach or understanding. The lack of any substantive content leads to a high probability of a score of 0.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant clearly understood the task rules and structure, as evidenced by their systematic approach to moving from left to right and switching based on specific failure conditions. The reflection shows a good grasp of the task's mechanics, hence the high scores in the upper range.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a clear hypothesis or plan (moving left to right and switching after two failures), indicating a structured approach to the task. The reflection shows a thoughtful plan, thus scoring higher in the judgment dimension.

**Evaluation:** The participant did reflect on their strategy's effectiveness to some extent, mentioning sticking with it throughout the game, which implies some level of evaluation. However, there's less depth on why this strategy was effective or not, leading to a moderate score.

**Final Decision:** The participant described a consistent rule or decision strategy they applied throughout the task, with clear rules on when to switch. This shows a high level of adherence to a final decision strategy, justifying a high score.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task by recognizing the need to alternate between options to find the most valuable one. The reflection indicates some understanding but lacks depth about the overall structure or goal beyond finding the ""most valuable"" partner. The probabilities reflect a good but not exemplary understanding.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan to alternate between partners, which shows some level of strategic thinking. However, the strategy is not elaborated upon deeply, suggesting a good but not sophisticated level of judgment.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting that the second partner seemed most valuable, indicating some evaluation. However, there is minimal insight into why this might be the case or a deeper analysis of the strategy's effectiveness across different scenarios.

**Final Decision:** The participant seems to have settled on focusing more on the second partner as the task progressed, indicating a decision strategy. The reflection suggests a reasonably clear final decision but lacks a detailed explanation of how this decision was reached or its implications.

**Confidence:** The participant does not express strong confidence or doubt explicitly. The reflection suggests a moderate level of certainty about their approach, as they did not switch strategies and identified a seemingly effective option.

- **Comprehension**: The participant's response suggests a basic understanding of the task as they mention picking options that ""seemed more likely."" This indicates some grasp of the probabilistic nature of the task, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.
- **Judgment**: The participant explicitly states they did not use any strategies, which implies a lack of deliberate planning or hypothesis formation. This is almost entirely absent, thus a high probability for a ""Rudimentary"" score.
- **Evaluation**: There is no reflection on the effectiveness of their approach or any reasoning about why they chose as they did, beyond the minimal acknowledgment of likelihood. This dimension is largely absent.
- **Final Decision**: The participant indicates a consistent approach of choosing based on perceived likelihood, which suggests some form of decision rule, albeit a simple one. This leans towards an ""Adequate"" score.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's reflection suggests a basic understanding of the task dynamics as they mention adapting their strategy based on their partner's performance. However, the depth of understanding the task rules or structure isn't explicitly clear, hence a higher probability for a score of 2 (Adequate).

**Judgment:** The participant indicates some form of planning or hypothesis formation as they decided to switch strategies based on the unfolding situation. The reflection lacks detail on the specifics of the judgment process, leading to a higher score in the Adequate range.

**Evaluation:** The participant does reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly suggesting that they switched upon observing a negative outcome. However, there is minimal insight into why they believed the strategy worked or didn't, thus a higher score in the Rudimentary to Adequate range.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a decision to switch strategies, indicating some level of consistent rule application towards the end. The reflection suggests a moderate level of clarity in their final decision-making process, justifying a higher score in the Good range.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their approach or understanding is not strongly conveyed. There is an implicit sense of trial and error, suggesting some uncertainty. This leads to a higher probability in the Adequate range, with some possibility of Rudimentary or Good."

- **Comprehension**: The participant shows some understanding of the task as they mention reacting to negative outcomes and changing their choice. However, the reflection lacks depth in explaining the task structure or goals, suggesting a score leaning towards ""Adequate"" to ""Good"".
- **Judgment**: The participant indicates a strategy (""Rode the hot hand"") and a response to changing conditions (""went to the right""), which shows some planning and hypothesis formation. The reflection suggests a ""Good"" understanding with some possibility of being ""Exemplary"".
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the change when outcomes became negative, indicating some evaluation. The reflection is more towards ""Good"" but not fully comprehensive.
- **Final Decision**: The participant mentions sticking to a strategy but also occasionally trying something different. This shows some consistency but also flexibility, aligning with a ""Good"" score but not fully exemplary.
- **Confidence**: The participant's language shows some uncertainty and lack of firm commitment to the strategy (""occasionally do something different""), suggesting moderate confidence. The probabilities lean towards ""Adequate"" with some uncertainty reflected in the score."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows an understanding of the task's structure by recognizing the need to reassess a choice after a negative outcome. The strategy of giving a ""person"" a second chance suggests an understanding of the probabilistic nature of the task. The response is somewhat clear but lacks depth in explaining the full task structure, hence a higher probability for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy involves forming a hypothesis (giving a second chance to confirm a pattern) before changing the decision. This indicates a planned approach to decision-making, meriting a higher score in judgment, leaning towards good (3) and exemplary (4).

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by deciding to switch after a repeated negative outcome, showing some evaluation of their approach's success. This reflection is somewhat clear but not deeply insightful, suggesting a higher score in the good range.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule for their decision-making process (giving a second chance before switching), which is articulated with moderate clarity. The strategy is somewhat sophisticated, indicating a higher probability for scores 3 and 4.

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their strategy, but the use of a conditional plan (""if it was negative again, I would switch"") suggests some level of certainty in their approach. The response leans more towards adequate and good, with some probability for exemplary due to the structured decision-making process."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's goal, which is to identify the option that most frequently results in a reward (score of 100). The response indicates a grasp of the task structure but lacks depth in explaining the rules or the overall goal beyond the immediate task, hence the distribution leaning towards a good understanding but not exemplary.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a basic plan to monitor which option yielded the highest reward and to switch upon a decrease in reward frequency. This shows a clear strategy formation but lacks a sophisticated approach to hypothesis testing or anticipation of changes, thus a higher probability towards a good score.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by monitoring outcomes and adjusting based on those outcomes. This indicates some level of strategy evaluation, but the depth of this reflection is not fully developed, leading to a higher score in the good range.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy by switching options when the previously chosen option stops yielding the highest reward. This strategy is clear but not detailed in terms of how quickly or under what specific conditions they switch, thus a higher score in the good range.
- **Confidence**: The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their strategy. However, the straightforward statement of their approach suggests a moderate level of confidence in their method, reflected in the higher scores towards good and exemplary, assuming implicit confidence in their decision-making process."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows an understanding of the task's basic mechanics, as they mention sticking with a choice that yields high points. However, the reflection lacks depth in explaining the overall goal or structure beyond this point, suggesting a moderate understanding. Hence, the probabilities are split between ""Adequate"" and ""Good.""

**Judgment:** The participant indicates a clear plan or hypothesis by choosing to stick with a ""student"" that gives high points. This demonstrates some strategic planning, leaning more towards a ""Good"" understanding of how to approach the task, but not quite exemplary as the strategy is quite straightforward.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the point at which they would abandon their chosen option (""until they started losing me points""). This shows a good level of self-assessment, warranting a higher score in ""Evaluation.""

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (""stick with them until they started losing me points""), which is clear and somewhat sophisticated given the probabilistic nature of the task. This suggests a strong adherence to a chosen strategy, meriting a higher score in ""Final Decision.""

**Confidence:** The participant's response, particularly the use of a definitive statement and a clear strategy without expressing any doubt, indicates a high level of confidence in their approach. The lack of any questioning or uncertainty about their strategy justifies a high score in ""Confidence."""

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response indicates a basic understanding of the task as they mention switching strategies based on percentages, which suggests some grasp of the task's probabilistic nature. However, the response lacks depth or clarity about the full structure or goal of the task, hence the higher probabilities for lower scores.

**Judgment:** The participant mentions a strategy of switching ""people"" based on percentages, which implies some form of hypothesis or plan about how to act. The response, however, is not very detailed or sophisticated, leading to a higher probability for middle scores.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection on whether their strategy worked is implied but not explicitly detailed. They mention switching strategies, which suggests some level of evaluation, but do not provide reasons for the effectiveness of these changes, leading to a moderate score probability.

**Final Decision:** The participant indicates a decision strategy of switching based on percentages, but the explanation is vague and lacks a clear, consistent rule. This warrants a moderate score, as there is some indication of a strategy but not a well-articulated one.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their approach is not clearly expressed. The use of a guessing strategy initially and the brief mention of strategy switching suggest some uncertainty or lack of full confidence in their approach, leading to higher probabilities for lower scores."

- **Comprehension**: The participant shows an understanding of the task's goal (to avoid negative outcomes and find a better option) but does not explicitly mention understanding the rules or structure. The response suggests a basic grasp, hence a higher probability towards the middle scores.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a plan to switch to a more helpful person after experiencing losses, indicating a clear strategy. The response shows a good level of planning and hypothesis formation, leaning towards higher scores.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the conditions under which they would switch, which shows some evaluation. However, the depth of this reflection is not fully comprehensive, suggesting a higher score but not the highest.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule for their decision-making process (switching after several losses), which is fairly clear and indicates a thoughtful approach. This warrants a higher score.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's goal, which is to stick with a successful strategy and change when it stops working. The clarity and depth are not fully developed, but there is a reasonable understanding, hence the higher probabilities towards the upper end of the scale.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a clear plan (following the successful ""person"") and had a contingency for when to switch strategies. This indicates a good level of judgment, though not fully sophisticated or detailed in explanation.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the change when the chosen ""person"" stopped being successful. This shows some evaluation but lacks depth in analyzing why the strategy worked or didn't, hence a moderate score.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states that they stuck with one strategy throughout, despite initially mentioning a change. This contradiction might suggest confusion, but the final adherence to one strategy is strongly affirmed, leading to a higher score in this dimension.

**Confidence:** The participant's statement is somewhat contradictory but ends with a firm declaration of sticking to one strategy, indicating a fair amount of confidence in their approach by the end of the task. The score leans towards higher confidence, reflecting this final assertiveness."

The response suggests an adequate grasp but lacks depth in explaining the overall goal or rules beyond the immediate strategy, hence a higher probability for scores 2 and 3.
- **Judgment**: The participant clearly formed a plan (switching after two failures), indicating a strategic approach. The clarity and simplicity of the plan suggest a higher score, leaning towards good, as it shows a clear hypothesis about how to act.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's reflection on the strategy's effectiveness is implied but not explicitly detailed. They mention a specific action (switching after failures) but do not deeply analyze its success or failure, leading to a moderate score.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule they applied (switching after two consecutive failures), which is a clear decision strategy. The simplicity and clarity of this rule suggest a higher score, leaning towards good and exemplary.
- **Confidence**: The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their strategy. The brief and straightforward nature of the response suggests some uncertainty, as there is no strong affirmation or doubt expressed, leading to a moderate score in this dimension."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's brief statement implies a basic understanding of the task's dynamics (switching decks when outcomes are unfavorable), but lacks depth or explicit acknowledgment of the task's rules or goals. The probability distribution reflects some understanding but not at a sophisticated level.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of switching decks based on performance suggests some form of planning or hypothesis (i.e., ""if a deck gets bad, switch""), but the reflection is too brief to assess a deeper strategic approach. The distribution leans towards an adequate understanding with some good insight due to the implied hypothesis.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection on the strategy's effectiveness is minimal and indirect (""not really""), indicating some evaluation but very limited in depth. The probabilities suggest a rudimentary to adequate level of reflection on the strategy's success.

**Final Decision:** The participant indicates a decision strategy (switching decks when they seem bad), but the strategy is not described in detail nor is it clear if this was consistently applied throughout the task. The distribution reflects an adequate understanding with some good insight.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their strategy is unclear and seems low, as indicated by the phrase ""not really."" This suggests some doubt about the effectiveness of their approach. The probabilities reflect uncertainty, leaning towards a lower confidence level."

The response does not demonstrate an understanding of the task rules, structure, or goal (Comprehension), nor does it show any evidence of forming a hypothesis or plan (Judgment). There is no reflection on the effectiveness of any strategy or reasoning behind actions (Evaluation), and no consistent rule or decision strategy is described (Final Decision). Finally, the participant does not express any certainty or doubt about their approach or understanding, making it difficult to assess their Confidence.

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant clearly understood the task rules and goals, as evidenced by their method of selecting partners based on performance and switching when performance dropped. The reflection shows a good grasp of the task structure, hence the high scores.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a clear hypothesis about how to act, choosing partners based on their success rate and switching upon a decline in performance. This indicates a well-thought-out plan, meriting a high score.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflected on the effectiveness of their strategy by monitoring the outcomes (positive or negative scores) and deciding when to switch partners. This shows a good level of self-assessment, deserving a high score.
- **Final Decision**: The participant described a consistent rule or decision strategy throughout the task, sticking to a partner until a decline in performance was observed. This clear and consistent strategy justifies a high score.
- **Confidence**: The participant expressed a high level of certainty in their approach, stating they did not really change their strategy and adhered to the initial plan. This strong conviction supports a high score in confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant clearly understood the task rules and structure, as evidenced by their strategy of staying with a choice until receiving two negative outcomes. This shows a good grasp of the task's probabilistic nature and the need for a systematic approach to maximize gains. The high scores reflect this understanding.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy formulation (""stay on someone who was giving '+100' until they gave me two '-50s' in a row"") indicates a clear and thoughtful plan based on the task's reward structure. This demonstrates a good level of judgment in hypothesizing a viable strategy.

**Evaluation:** The participant implicitly evaluated their strategy by sticking to it throughout the game, suggesting it worked sufficiently for them. They did not explicitly state their reflections on the strategy's effectiveness, but the consistency in application implies some level of evaluation.

**Final Decision:** The participant explicitly stated that they used the same strategy throughout the game, indicating a strong and consistent decision-making process. This high score reflects their commitment to their chosen approach despite the task's challenges.

**Confidence:** The participant's statement of sticking with the same strategy throughout the game and the lack of any expressed doubt about their approach suggest a high level of confidence in their strategy and understanding of the task. This is reflected in the high score for this dimension."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's goal (maximizing points and minimizing losses), but the reflection lacks depth in explaining the structure or rules of the task. The probabilities reflect a mostly adequate understanding with some room for more detailed comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant clearly formed a strategy based on their understanding of the task, which involved searching for the most rewarding option. The reflection indicates a plan of action, hence the higher probabilities for good and exemplary scores.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on their strategy's effectiveness to some extent by sticking to it throughout the task, indicating it worked for them. However, there is minimal insight into why this strategy worked or any consideration of alternative strategies, leading to a higher probability for an adequate score.

**Final Decision:** The participant consistently applied their strategy throughout the task, as indicated by their statement of not changing it and continuously searching for the best option. This shows a clear decision-making process, warranting higher scores in this dimension.

**Confidence:** The participant's reflection does not explicitly express confidence, but the fact that they did not change their strategy and described it straightforwardly suggests a level of certainty about their approach.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response is minimal and somewhat unclear, indicating a basic or rudimentary understanding of the task's structure or goal. The mention of ""100 points"" suggests some grasp of the task's mechanics, but the overall comprehension is not deeply articulated or detailed.

**Judgment:** The response vaguely hints at a strategy (""which ever player was steady giving 100 points""), suggesting a rudimentary to adequate level of forming a hypothesis or plan. However, the lack of clarity and detail in the strategy description leads to a lower score.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection on whether their strategy worked is minimal and lacks depth, as indicated by the terse response. There is a slight indication of evaluation (""no""), but it's not clear what is being evaluated or why the strategy might not have worked, leading to a lower score.

**Final Decision:** The participant does not clearly describe a consistent rule or decision strategy they ultimately applied. The response is ambiguous and does not provide a clear decision-making process, leading to a score that reflects uncertainty about the participant's final strategy.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their approach or understanding is not explicitly stated and can only be inferred with difficulty. The use of a simple negative (""no"") might suggest some level of doubt, but overall, the confidence level expressed is unclear and minimal."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows some understanding of the task by sticking to a strategy based on initial success (""the first partner that gave me a 100""). This indicates a basic grasp of the task's reward system, but lacks depth in understanding the probabilistic or reversal elements of the task. Hence, a higher probability is given to an ""Adequate"" score.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a basic plan to stick with the initially successful option. This shows some level of strategic planning, but it's not sophisticated or adaptive. A ""Good"" score is more probable as the participant did form a clear, though simple, plan.
- **Evaluation**: The reflection lacks a detailed evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness beyond the initial success. The participant does not reflect on whether this approach was effective throughout the task or why it might/might not have been effective, leading to a higher probability for a ""Rudimentary"" score.
- **Final Decision**: The participant clearly states that they did not switch strategies, indicating a consistent decision strategy. However, the lack of adaptation or complexity in this strategy suggests a score between ""Adequate"" and ""Good.""
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief and straightforward response suggests a high level of confidence in their chosen strategy, despite its simplicity. The lack of doubt or uncertainty in their reflection supports a higher score in this dimension."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows an understanding of the task's feedback mechanism by mentioning the -50 score, but does not explicitly discuss the overall goal or rules beyond this. The response suggests a basic grasp but lacks depth, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.
- **Judgment**: The participant describes a specific strategy (waiting for -50 twice before switching), indicating some planning and hypothesis formation. The clarity and specificity of this strategy suggest a good understanding of how to approach the task, leaning towards a higher score.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy or why it might have worked or failed, only stating what they did. This lack of reflection justifies a higher probability for lower scores in this dimension.
- **Final Decision**: The clear articulation of a consistent rule (""waited until I got -50 twice"") for decision-making during the task suggests a good to exemplary understanding and application of a final decision strategy.
- **Confidence**: The participant does not express any explicit confidence or doubt about their strategy. The terse nature of the response and the lack of any qualifying statements suggest moderate uncertainty, hence a higher probability for lower scores in this dimension."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant clearly understood the task rules and structure, as evidenced by their method of sticking with one figure until a specific negative outcome occurred twice, then switching. This shows a good grasp of the task's probabilistic nature and the goal of maximizing rewards. The response is sophisticated in its simplicity and adherence to a clear rule, suggesting a high level of comprehension.

**Judgment:**  
The participant formed a clear hypothesis or plan about how to act, which was to stay with one choice until it failed twice, then switch. This strategy is not only mentioned but also implies a systematic approach to decision-making within the task's framework, indicating a high level of judgment.

**Evaluation:**  
While the participant did not explicitly state an evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness, the implication that they continued with this strategy throughout suggests an implicit evaluation that it was effective enough to not warrant a change. The reflection on strategy effectiveness is somewhat indirect but can be inferred from the consistency in strategy use.

**Final Decision:**  
The participant described a very consistent rule or decision strategy, which was to switch figures only after receiving two negative outcomes in a row. This shows a high level of adherence to a chosen strategy, indicating a strong final decision-making process.

**Confidence:**  
The participant's brief statement reflects a high level of confidence in their chosen strategy, as they did not switch strategies and succinctly described their approach without expressing any doubt. The lack of questioning or reconsideration of the approach suggests strong confidence in their decision-making."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's structure by recognizing the reward system and adapting their choices based on it. The response indicates a good grasp but lacks a detailed explanation of the task rules or goals, hence the higher probabilities for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant explicitly mentions using a pattern-based strategy, which reflects a clear plan of action (sticking with a rewarding option). This demonstrates a good level of judgment in forming a hypothesis about how to act, justifying the higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting consistency and sticking with a rewarding option until a change occurs. However, there is minimal insight into why this strategy worked or didn't, which is why the probabilities are higher for scores 2 and 3, with a small chance for a 4.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (""stick with that partner until something changes""), indicating a clear final decision-making process. The response leans towards a higher understanding and application of a decision strategy, justifying higher scores in 3 and 4.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses a sense of certainty about their approach (""I was pretty consistent with my strategy I feel""), suggesting confidence in their understanding and strategy use. The probabilities are skewed towards higher scores (3 and 4) to reflect this confidence, with a slight possibility of a lower score due to the use of ""I feel,"" which might introduce a bit of doubt."

- **Comprehension**: The participant shows an understanding of the task's structure by describing their method of interacting with different ""persons"" based on the results received. The reflection indicates a grasp of the task's probabilistic nature, hence the higher scores towards the upper end.
- **Judgment**: The participant describes a clear strategy of giving a person another chance before switching, which shows planning and hypothesis formation about how to act. The reflection leans more towards a good understanding, hence a higher score in the upper range.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the change in behavior (""people tend to flip 5050 more often"") and adjusting their approach accordingly. This shows a good level of self-evaluation, meriting higher scores.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy by sticking with the same person towards the end to maximize positive results. This indicates a clear and consistent decision-making process, justifying higher scores.

Confidence: [0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.0]  

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by indicating a response to negative outcomes (""If I got a negative 2 times I moved on to another person""). This suggests some grasp of the task structure but lacks depth in explaining the overall goal or rules comprehensively. The probability distribution leans towards ""Adequate"" as the participant understands the task to some extent but does not elaborate.

**Judgment:**  
The participant's strategy (""moved on to another person"" after two negatives) reflects a clear plan or hypothesis about how to act, indicating a decision-making process based on the outcomes received. The response is somewhat clear and thoughtful, suggesting a ""Good"" level of judgment with a possibility of being ""Exemplary"" due to the strategic shift based on specific conditions.

**Evaluation:**  
The reflection includes a minimal evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness. The participant does not explicitly reflect on why this strategy was chosen or its success rate, only that the strategy was to switch after certain conditions were met. This warrants a score leaning towards ""Adequate"" as there is some implicit evaluation but not deeply analyzed or explained.

**Final Decision:**  
The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (""If I got a negative 2 times I moved on to another person""), which shows a clear final decision-making process. This response is more towards ""Good"" as it clearly states what the participant decided to do consistently throughout the task, with some probability of being ""Exemplary"" if interpreted as a well-considered strategy.

**Confidence:**  
The participant's confidence in their approach is not explicitly stated, and the use of a semicolon followed by ""no"" might indicate some doubt or reconsideration of their statement. This ambiguity suggests uncertainty about their approach or understanding, leading to a distribution that spans from ""Rudimentary"" to ""Good,"" reflecting mixed signals about their confidence level."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant's reflection indicates a basic understanding of the task's goal (finding the dependable option and sticking with it). The response suggests a grasp of the task structure but lacks detailed explanation of the rules or deeper insights into the task's complexity. The probabilities reflect a good understanding but not an exemplary one.

**Judgment:**  
The participant formed a clear plan (to stick with a dependable choice), which shows a good level of judgment. The reflection, however, does not delve into alternative strategies or adjustments that might have been considered, which prevents a higher score.

**Evaluation:**  
The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly suggesting it worked until a switch was necessary. However, there is minimal insight into why the strategy worked or didn't, which limits the score to a mix between adequate and good.

**Final Decision:**  
The participant clearly states that they adhered to their initial strategy throughout the task, indicating a strong and consistent decision-making process. This is reflected in the high probability for a score of 4, showing exemplary adherence to a chosen strategy.

**Confidence:**  
The participant's confidence in their strategy is implied through their commitment to it throughout the task and the lack of expressed doubt. The reflection does not explicitly state confidence, but the adherence to the strategy suggests a high level of confidence, meriting a higher score in this dimension."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows some understanding of the task rules by mentioning a specific condition under which they would switch strategies. However, the depth of understanding the overall task structure or goal is not fully articulated, hence a higher probability in the middle range (2 and 3).

**Judgment:** The participant explicitly mentions a conditional strategy (""If I got -50 twice in a row, I would switch""), indicating a clear hypothesis about how to act. This suggests a good level of judgment, leaning towards higher scores.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the development of their strategy over time, indicating some evaluation of their approach's effectiveness. However, the depth of this reflection is not fully comprehensive, warranting a higher score in the middle range.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a specific rule they applied (""switch after -50 twice""), which shows a consistent decision strategy. The clarity and specificity of this rule suggest a higher score, leaning towards exemplary.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence is somewhat ambiguous. They start with guesswork and develop a strategy over time, which shows some uncertainty initially but more confidence as the task progresses. The scores are distributed to reflect this progression from doubt to moderate confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant seems to have a basic understanding of the task as they describe using services until they fail. This suggests some grasp of the task's structure of evaluating choices based on outcomes. However, the response lacks depth in explaining the rules or goals explicitly, hence the higher probabilities for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy formulation is evident as they describe sticking with a choice until it fails repeatedly. This indicates a planned approach, meriting a higher score in judgment. The response suggests a somewhat sophisticated strategy, leaning towards scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by mentioning the discontinuation of using services after consecutive failures. This shows some evaluation of their strategy's success, warranting moderate to high scores.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states that they maintained the same strategy throughout the task. This consistency and clarity in their decision-making process suggest a higher score, with a significant probability for a score of 4.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by describing their response to specific outcomes (-50 and 100). They demonstrate a grasp of the task structure and goals, though not in a sophisticated manner. The probability leans towards a good understanding but not exemplary, as the insight into the broader task structure or variations is not mentioned.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a clear plan based on the outcomes of their choices, indicating a strategy based on the rewards received. This shows a good level of judgment, though not highly sophisticated or nuanced, hence the distribution leaning towards a score of 3.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly suggesting it did not require change. However, there is little depth in analyzing why this strategy worked or considering alternative strategies, which suggests an adequate level of evaluation.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states they did not switch strategies, indicating a strong adherence to their chosen approach throughout the task. This shows a high level of consistency in their decision-making process, justifying a high score in this dimension.

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant clearly understood the task rules and structure, as evidenced by their strategy of switching decks based on the number of consecutive losses. The reflection shows a good grasp of the task's goal, which is to minimize losses by adapting the strategy. The probability leans towards higher scores because the participant's understanding is implicit in their strategic adjustments.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a clear hypothesis or plan about how to act, initially switching decks after one loss and then adjusting to switch after two consecutive losses. This shows a progression in their planning and hypothesis testing, deserving a higher score.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflected on the effectiveness of their initial strategy and made adjustments based on their observations, indicating some level of evaluation. They did not explicitly state why they thought one strategy worked better than the other, but the change implies some evaluation was made.
- **Final Decision**: The participant described a consistent rule or decision strategy they ultimately applied, which was to switch decks after two consecutive losses. This shows a clear and thoughtful decision-making process.
- **Confidence**: The participant's strategy shift and the clarity in their final decision suggest a level of confidence in their approach. They did not express doubt, and the adjustment in strategy indicates they were confident enough in their observations to make a change."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response indicates a basic understanding of the task as they mention ""counting the times i got the correct answer on which person."" This suggests they grasped the task involved identifying correct choices, but the depth of understanding the task's structure or goal is not fully articulated. Hence, a higher probability is given to a score of 2 (Adequate).

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of counting correct answers implies some form of planning or hypothesis about how to approach the task. However, the reflection lacks detail on how this strategy was formulated or its underlying rationale, leading to a higher probability for a score of 2 (Adequate).

**Evaluation:** The participant does not reflect on whether their strategy was effective or why it might have been so. The response ""no"" when asked if they switched strategies does not provide insight into their evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness. Therefore, a high probability is assigned to a score of 0 (Absent).

**Final Decision:** The participant mentions a specific strategy but does not elaborate on whether they consistently applied this strategy throughout the task or adapted it based on task performance. The response is somewhat unclear, leading to a higher probability for a score of 2 (Adequate).

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and somewhat ambiguous response does not convey a strong sense of certainty or doubt about their understanding or strategy. The lack of explicit confidence or self-assessment cues leads to a higher probability for a score of 0 (Absent)."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response indicates a basic understanding of the task's feedback mechanism (responding to two negatives), but lacks depth in explaining the overall goal or rules. The response is somewhat clear but not detailed, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.

**Judgment:** The participant explicitly mentions a decision rule based on the task's feedback (""two negatives in a row made me usually switch""), which shows some planning. The response suggests a moderate level of strategic thinking, leaning towards a ""Good"" score.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly suggesting that switching after two negatives was a deliberate choice, indicating some evaluation. The reflection isn't deeply analytical but shows awareness, thus a higher score in ""Good.""

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule (""two negatives in a row made me usually switch""), indicating a clear decision strategy. The response is concise but shows a definitive strategy, supporting a higher score in ""Good"" to ""Exemplary.""

**Confidence:** The participant's brief response does not explicitly express confidence, but the use of a definitive strategy (""usually switch"") and the lack of questioning their own approach suggest a reasonable level of confidence. This supports a higher probability for ""Good"" to ""Exemplary."""

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows some understanding of the task by recognizing the negative outcome (-50) and attempting to discern a pattern. This indicates a basic grasp of the task's mechanics, though not deeply detailed or sophisticated.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy to ""stick with the deck for a few times"" after a negative outcome suggests a hypothesis about the task's pattern. This demonstrates some planning and hypothesis formation, warranting a higher score in judgment.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by continuing with the same deck to test for a pattern. This shows some evaluation of their approach, though it lacks depth in analyzing why this strategy was chosen or its effectiveness beyond the immediate results.

**Final Decision:** The participant indicates a decision strategy of sticking with a choice after a negative outcome to test consistency, which shows a clear rule they applied. This decision-making process is somewhat consistent and strategic, deserving a higher score.

**Confidence:** The participant does not express strong confidence or doubt; their language is somewhat neutral and factual. This suggests moderate uncertainty about their strategy's effectiveness, reflected in the middle-range scores for confidence."

**Comprehension:** The participant's response indicates a basic understanding of the task's goal (to find the teammate that would give the highest points). However, there is no mention of understanding the rules or structure beyond this point, suggesting a moderate level of comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy to consistently find the highest point-giving teammate implies some level of planning or hypothesis formation. The clarity and simplicity of the strategy suggest a good level of judgment, though not highly sophisticated or varied.

**Evaluation:** The participant did not reflect on whether their strategy worked or why, which suggests a lack of evaluation. The response is mostly focused on the strategy used without any assessment of its effectiveness or reasoning behind its success or failure.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly stated that they did not switch strategies and consistently applied the same decision rule throughout the task. This shows a high level of consistency and clarity in their final decision-making process.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief response does not explicitly state confidence, but the lack of questioning or doubt about their chosen strategy and the straightforward assertion of their approach suggest a relatively high level of confidence in their understanding and strategy."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant clearly understood the task rules as they described a specific strategy based on the outcomes of their actions (switching after 2 negatives). The probability leans heavily towards a higher score because the participant's strategy directly reflects an understanding of the task's probabilistic nature.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a clear plan (switching after 2 negatives) indicating a hypothesis about how to act within the task's structure. This shows a good level of judgment in forming a strategy based on the task's feedback mechanism.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's reflection on whether their strategy worked is implicit rather than explicit. They did not provide a detailed analysis of the strategy's effectiveness but did imply some level of ongoing assessment by sticking to their plan throughout. The probabilities are spread across the middle scores to reflect this partial evaluation.
- **Final Decision**: The participant expressed a consistent rule or decision strategy (switching after 2 negatives) and confirmed they did not change this strategy throughout the task. This shows a high level of commitment to their chosen approach, justifying a high score.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief and straightforward affirmation of their unchanging strategy (""No, stayed the same"") alongside their clear rule suggests a high level of confidence in their approach. The high probability towards a score of 4 reflects this strong certainty."

Rationale: The participant's reflection is extremely brief and lacks depth across all dimensions. The response ""no strategy ; no"" suggests a minimal understanding of the task and an absence of strategic thinking or evaluation.

- **Comprehension**: The participant's response implies a very rudimentary understanding of the task, as they acknowledge the concept of using a strategy but claim not to have used one. This suggests some level of comprehension but is far from clear or detailed.
- **Judgment**: The participant indicates no use of a strategy, which suggests they did not form a hypothesis or plan, hence the high probability of a score close to 0.
- **Evaluation**: There is no reflection on the effectiveness of their approach or any reasoning provided, which justifies a high probability of a low score.
- **Final Decision**: The participant's statement implies they did not apply any consistent rule or decision strategy, supporting a high probability of a low score.
- **Confidence**: The brevity and nature of the response suggest low confidence in their approach or understanding of the task, although there is a slight chance they are confident in their decision to not employ a strategy."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by sticking to a deck until receiving two negative responses. However, the reflection lacks depth in explaining the structure or goal beyond this rule, suggesting a score leaning towards ""Adequate"" but not fully comprehensive.

**Judgment:**  
The participant indicates a decision-making process (""keep picking the same deck until I get two negative responses""), which reflects some planning. The mention of sticking with this strategy for most of the game suggests a somewhat consistent application, justifying a higher score in this dimension.

**Evaluation:**  
The participant's reflection on strategy effectiveness is minimal. They mention sticking with the strategy but do not deeply reflect on its success or reasons for its effectiveness or failure. This warrants a score around ""Adequate.""

**Final Decision:**  
The participant clearly states a consistent rule they applied throughout the task (""keep picking the same deck until I get two negative responses""). This shows a clear decision strategy, meriting a score leaning towards ""Good"" or ""Exemplary.""

**Confidence:**  
Confidence is somewhat implied through the consistency of the strategy used, but there is no explicit expression of certainty or doubt about their approach. The score is therefore centered around ""Adequate"" to ""Good,"" reflecting implicit confidence through action rather than explicit statement."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant demonstrates a good understanding of the task's structure and goals, as evidenced by their strategy of sticking with a ""student"" until failure and then reassessing. The analogy to students suggests a metaphorical understanding of the task elements (choices as students), indicating a sophisticated grasp. Hence, a high score is justified.

**Judgment:** The participant clearly formed a hypothesis about how to act, initially sticking with one choice until it failed and later adjusting their strategy based on performance reliability. This shows a progression in their planning and hypothesis formation, warranting a high score.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the reliability of one choice over others despite occasional failures. This indicates a thoughtful evaluation of strategy effectiveness, deserving a high score.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy they ultimately applied, which was to give a choice multiple chances if it showed long-term reliability. This shows a clear and thoughtful decision-making process, meriting a high score.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses some certainty in their approach by sticking to a revised strategy as the game progressed, but there is still some implied uncertainty as they adjusted their strategy based on the game's unfolding nature. This suggests moderate confidence, thus the distribution leaning towards the middle and higher end of the scale."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by recognizing that they should switch decks when outcomes become unfavorable. However, the reflection lacks depth in explaining the structure or goal beyond immediate responses to negative feedback, hence the higher probabilities for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan (continuing to choose a deck until it yields a negative outcome), indicating some level of strategic thinking. The reflection suggests a somewhat clear but not deeply sophisticated approach, leading to a higher score in the 3 range.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly acknowledging the need to switch after a significant loss (-50). This shows a good level of self-assessment, meriting a higher score in the 3 range, with some possibility for a 4 if interpreted as a nuanced understanding of risk and reward.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule (switching decks after negative outcomes), but the strategy is not elaborated in great detail. The reflection suggests a fairly reliable decision-making process, justifying a higher score in the 3 range, with some potential for a 4.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and somewhat casual response (""Yes."") when asked about strategy switching shows some confidence in their approach, but it lacks explicit self-assurance or detailed justification. This warrants a higher probability towards scores 3 and 4, recognizing some implicit confidence in their decision-making process."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows an understanding of the task rules by indicating a response to consecutive negative outcomes (three negatives in a row). This suggests a basic grasp of the task's feedback mechanism, though the reflection lacks depth about the overall goal or structure of the task. Hence, a higher probability is given to an ""Adequate"" score.

**Judgment:** The participant's statement about switching cards after three negative outcomes indicates a planned response to specific conditions, showing some level of strategic thinking. The reflection, however, is brief and lacks detailed explanation of the strategy's formulation, leading to a higher score in ""Good.""

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly suggesting that a change was necessary after repeated negative feedback. The semi-colon followed by ""Not really"" hints at some evaluation of this decision, though it's not deeply elaborated, justifying a higher score in ""Good.""

**Final Decision:** The participant indicates a decision rule (switching after three negatives), but the addition of ""Not really"" introduces ambiguity about the consistency of this strategy. This suggests some level of strategic consistency but also uncertainty or reconsideration, leading to a higher probability in ""Good"" and ""Exemplary.""

**Confidence:** The inclusion of ""Not really"" after stating a decision rule suggests a level of uncertainty or doubt about the chosen approach. This shows self-awareness regarding the confidence in their strategy, warranting a higher score in ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"" for expressing thoughtful restraint and uncertainty."

- **Judgment**: The participant formed a basic plan (choosing the option that previously gave a high reward), which shows some judgment. The distribution leans towards a ""Good"" rating because they had a clear, though simple, hypothesis.
- **Evaluation**: The participant did not reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy beyond a simple negative answer to whether they changed strategies. This suggests a lack of deep evaluation, hence the higher probability for a lower score.
- **Final Decision**: The participant stuck with a consistent decision strategy (choosing the same rewarding option), which is somewhat articulated. The distribution suggests a moderate to good understanding and application of a decision rule.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief response shows some level of uncertainty or minimal confidence in their approach, reflected in the higher probabilities for lower scores. The lack of elaboration or strong assertion about their strategy suggests lower confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows some understanding of the task's dynamics, as indicated by their strategy of sticking with one option until it fails consistently. However, the reflection lacks a detailed explanation of the task rules or goals, suggesting a moderate level of comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant describes forming a strategy based on the performance of their choices, indicating some level of planning and hypothesis formation. The mention of finding a ""good pattern"" and sticking with certain ""people"" until a rhythm is found suggests a more thoughtful approach, warranting a higher score.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the need to switch when all options fail, showing some evaluation. However, the depth of this reflection is not fully comprehensive, as it lacks detailed analysis of why specific strategies worked or failed.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy by sticking with certain options once a rhythm is established. This indicates a relatively clear and somewhat sophisticated decision-making process, deserving a higher score.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant seems to understand the task as involving choices (persons) and consequences (failure), and the strategy involves giving chances and then moving on. The understanding is somewhat clear but lacks depth about the task's structure or goals, hence a higher probability for a score of 2.

**Judgment:** The participant describes a specific hypothesis about how to act (giving a second chance and then moving on after repeated failure). This indicates a planned approach, scoring higher in judgment, with a good probability of scoring 3.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the strategy's outcome (moving on after two failures), suggesting some evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness. This shows a moderate level of reflection, leaning towards a score of 3.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule (giving a second chance, then switching after two failures), indicating a clear decision strategy. This suggests a higher score, with a good chance of scoring 4.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's brief statement indicates a basic understanding of the task's requirement to adapt strategies based on outcomes (changing strategy after two losses). The response is somewhat clear but lacks depth, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of changing after two losses suggests a planned approach, indicating some judgment. The clarity and simplicity of the plan suggest a ""Good"" score, but the lack of detailed reasoning prevents a higher score.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by indicating a change after losses, which shows some evaluation. The reflection on strategy effectiveness is clear but not deeply insightful, supporting a higher probability for a ""Good"" score.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule (changing after two losses), which shows some decision-making. The strategy is somewhat clear and consistent, justifying a higher score in ""Good,"" with some probability for ""Exemplary"" due to the clear rule application.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows some understanding of the task structure by recognizing the need to switch decks, indicating they grasped the basic rules. However, the depth of understanding the overall goal or structure isn't fully articulated, hence a higher probability in the middle range.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan (switching decks based on performance), which shows some judgment. The reflection includes a strategy, but it lacks a detailed explanation of how decisions were made initially, leading to a higher score in the ""Good"" range.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on their strategy's effectiveness, noting that they stayed with a deck even when it wasn't favorable. This shows a good level of self-evaluation and awareness of strategy effectiveness, justifying higher scores in ""Good"" and ""Exemplary.""

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule they applied (staying longer with a deck), which shows a clear decision strategy, especially towards the end of the task. This is reflected in the higher scores towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary.""

**Confidence:** The participant expresses some uncertainty about their approach (""whenever I felt""), indicating a mix of certainty and doubt. This mixed expression justifies a balanced distribution across the scale, with a slight lean towards ""Adequate."""

**Judgment:** The participant indicates a strategy of going back and forth between choices, suggesting some form of hypothesis or plan. The response is somewhat clear but lacks detailed reasoning or sophistication, leading to a higher probability for a ""Good"" score.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection does not clearly articulate whether their strategy was effective or why it might have been so. The response is mostly absent of evaluative content, thus a high probability for an ""Absent"" score.

**Final Decision:** The participant's strategy description (""going back and forth"") suggests some consistency in their approach, but it is not articulated in a sophisticated or fully rational manner. This leads to a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.

- **Judgment**: The participant indicates a strategy (""wait for a bad card twice"") which shows some planning. The strategy is somewhat clear but not detailed or sophisticated, leading to a higher probability for an adequate score.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting that the situation ""stayed pretty much the same."" This suggests some evaluation but lacks depth or detailed reasoning about why the strategy worked or didn't work.
- **Final Decision**: The participant mentions a consistent approach but does not elaborate on its effectiveness or any adjustments made. This suggests a moderate level of clarity in their decision-making process.
- **Confidence**: The participant's statement shows some uncertainty and lack of confidence in the outcome (""stayed pretty much the same""), indicating they are not fully confident in their strategy or its results. This leads to a higher probability for an adequate score."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant indicates an understanding of the task by mentioning their attempt to ""find out the pattern"" which suggests they grasped the goal of identifying a pattern in choices. The response is somewhat clear but lacks depth about the structure or rules, hence a higher probability for a score of 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant explicitly states their strategy to ""bounce back and forth"" and to ""think what it could be next,"" showing they formed a plan based on their understanding. This indicates a good level of judgment, leaning towards a score of 3.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on their strategy by acknowledging their attempts to figure out the pattern, but they do not deeply analyze whether this strategy was effective or why. This suggests a moderate level of evaluation, with a higher probability for a score of 2.

**Final Decision:** The participant mentions a consistent approach of trying to predict and adjust their choices, but the description lacks a clear, definitive rule or strategy that was consistently applied. This suggests an adequate to good final decision-making process, with a higher probability for a score of 2 and 3.

**Confidence:** The participant does not express strong certainty or doubt about their approach; the reflection shows some level of confidence by stating their strategy but also implies uncertainty by continuously trying to figure out the pattern. This suggests an adequate level of confidence, with a higher probability for a score of 2."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant demonstrates a clear understanding of the task rules and structure, particularly the consequences of receiving -50s and the potential for positive streaks. The reflection shows a sophisticated grasp of the task dynamics, hence the high scores in the upper range.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy formulation, such as deciding when to switch based on the outcomes (-50s), indicates a well-thought-out plan and hypothesis about how to act within the game. This reflects a high level of judgment, warranting scores leaning towards the higher end.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by acknowledging the possibility and benefit of switching after negative outcomes to potentially capitalize on positive streaks. This shows a good level of strategy evaluation, deserving a higher score.

**Final Decision:** The reflection describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (switching after two consecutive -50s and sometimes after one), indicating a clear and somewhat sophisticated decision-making process. This justifies a higher score in this dimension.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses a level of certainty in their approach, particularly in their decision to switch partners after negative outcomes, reflecting confidence in their understanding and strategy. This is supported by their acknowledgment of the game's structure and potential outcomes, suggesting a higher score."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows an understanding of the task's basic mechanism (finding and clicking a target), but lacks depth in explaining the rules or structure beyond the immediate action. The probability leans towards ""Adequate"" as they understood to click a choice until it changed.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a basic plan (to keep selecting a choice until it changed), indicating some level of strategic thinking. The score leans towards ""Good"" as there is a clear, albeit simple, plan.
- **Evaluation**: The participant did not reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy or why it might have worked or failed, hence the high probability for ""Absent.""
- **Final Decision**: The participant stuck to a consistent rule (clicking the same choice until it changed), which is a clear decision strategy. The score is skewed towards ""Exemplary"" as they did not waver in their approach.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief and somewhat ambiguous response (""no"" to strategy switching) suggests uncertainty or minimal self-assurance about their approach, leading to a higher probability for ""Adequate."""

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's statement ""each one I tried seemed to not follow through"" suggests a basic understanding of the task's trial-and-error nature, but lacks depth in explaining the task rules or goals. The response indicates some awareness but is not detailed, hence a higher probability for a score of 1.

**Judgment:** The participant's reflection shows some indication of forming strategies (""each one I tried""), implying attempts at planning or hypothesizing. However, the lack of specificity and depth in describing these strategies leads to a higher score in the lower range.

**Evaluation:** The phrase ""seemed to not follow through"" suggests a rudimentary reflection on the effectiveness of the strategies used, indicating some evaluation. However, the lack of detail about why strategies failed or succeeded leads to a moderate score.

**Final Decision:** The participant's brief and vague response does not clearly describe a consistent rule or decision strategy applied throughout the task. The statement ""yep often"" ambiguously suggests frequent changes without clarity, leading to a higher probability of lower scores.

**Confidence:** The participant's expression shows some uncertainty and lack of confidence in the strategies used (""seemed to not follow through""), but does not strongly convey either confidence or doubt. The response leans towards lower confidence, hence a higher score in the lower range."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows an understanding of the task's goal (maximizing positive scores) and the basic rule of sticking with a choice that yields positive outcomes. The mention of trying to ""figure out a sequence"" suggests some grasp of the task's structure, though not fully sophisticated.
- **Judgment**: The participant clearly formed a plan to stick with a choice as long as it yielded positive results and then attempted to discern a pattern or sequence. This indicates a strategic approach, though the depth of strategic planning is not fully clear.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the strategy by indicating a shift from one approach to another, suggesting some level of evaluation. However, there is no detailed analysis of why the strategy was changed or its effectiveness, leading to a moderate score.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule initially (sticking with a positive outcome) and hints at a shift in strategy. This shows some level of decision-making but lacks a clear, final strategy that was consistently applied throughout.
- **Confidence**: The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their approach. The reflection suggests some uncertainty as they attempted to ""figure out a sequence,"" indicating they were not entirely sure of their initial strategy. This leads to a moderate score in confidence, leaning towards uncertainty."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task by recognizing the goal of finding the ""100"" and responding to changes. The response indicates some grasp of the task structure but lacks depth in explaining the rules or goals beyond the immediate response to changes, hence a higher probability for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of sticking with the ""100"" and searching for another ""100"" after a sabotage implies a planned approach, though not elaborately described. The clarity in their plan suggests a good level of judgment, leading to a higher probability for score 3.

**Evaluation:** The participant briefly reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by continuing to search for ""100"" after sabotage, indicating some evaluation. However, there is minimal insight into why this strategy was effective or not, leading to a higher probability for score 2.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states their decision to stick with the ""100"" and look for another ""100"" after sabotage, showing a consistent rule in their strategy. This clarity and consistency in decision-making justify a higher probability for scores 4 and 3.

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their strategy. The brief and straightforward nature of the response suggests some level of certainty but not enough to score highly on confidence. Thus, a higher probability is given to scores 2 and 3, indicating moderate confidence."

**Rationale:**  
The reflection provided, ""Focused Idea ; NO,"" is extremely brief and lacks substantive content across all metacognitive dimensions. 

- **Comprehension:** The phrase ""Focused Idea"" suggests a minimal understanding of having a strategy or approach, but it is not clear if the participant comprehends the task rules, structure, or goal. The probability is high (0.8) for a score of 0 due to the lack of clear evidence of understanding.
  
- **Judgment:** The reflection does not clearly indicate that the participant formed a hypothesis or plan about how to act, other than a vague notion of having a ""focused idea."" The probability of a score of 0 remains high (0.8) due to the absence of explicit planning or hypothesis formation.

- **Evaluation:** There is no indication that the participant reflected on whether their strategy worked or why it might have worked or failed. The reflection lacks any evaluative content, leading to a high probability (0.8) of a score of 0.

- **Final Decision:** The reflection does not describe any consistent rule or decision strategy that was ultimately applied. The term ""NO"" is ambiguous and does not clarify the nature of the final decision. Thus, the probability of a score of 0 is high (0.8).

- **Confidence:** The participant does not express any certainty or doubt about their approach or understanding. The reflection lacks any language indicating confidence, leading to a high probability (0.8) of a score of 0.

Overall, the reflection is too brief and vague to provide meaningful insights into the participant's metacognitive processes regarding the task."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows a good understanding of the task's goal, which is to identify patterns and make decisions based on those patterns. The reflection indicates a clear grasp of the task's structure and goals, hence the higher probabilities towards the upper end of the scale.
- **Judgment**: The participant explicitly mentions trying different strategies to find patterns, indicating a clear formation of hypotheses and plans. The reflection shows a progression in strategy application, justifying higher scores in judgment.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategies by shifting from one pattern-seeking method to another, indicating some level of evaluation. However, there is no deep insight into why specific strategies did or did not work, which limits the score to the middle range.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy by the end of the reflection, but it is not entirely clear if one strategy was settled upon as more effective than the others. This uncertainty results in a balanced distribution across the middle scores.
- **Confidence**: The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their strategies, leading to a moderate score. The reflection suggests some level of uncertainty, as indicated by strategy switching, but does not fully articulate confidence levels, hence the spread across the middle values."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows some understanding of the task by attempting to follow a positive result repeatedly. However, the depth of understanding the overall structure or goal of the task is not fully clear, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.

**Judgment:** The participant indicates a basic strategy (""stick with the positive result as many times in a row as I can""), suggesting some form of planning or hypothesis. The clarity and depth are somewhat limited, leading to a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" to ""Good"" score.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy is minimal and lacks depth (""I did not""), indicating they recognized a strategy failure but did not elaborate on why it might not have worked. This warrants a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule they tried to apply, but the reflection lacks depth on how this decision was adapted or optimized throughout the task. This suggests a score leaning towards ""Adequate"" to ""Good.""

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's brief reflection indicates some understanding of the task's requirement to adapt strategies based on outcomes, as shown by the mention of switching strategies after negative outcomes. However, the depth of understanding isn't fully clear, hence a higher probability in the middle range (2 and 3).

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy to switch after negative outcomes shows some level of planning and hypothesis formation about how to act within the task. The clarity isn't fully developed but suggests a thoughtful approach, leading to a higher score in the 'Good' range.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their strategy (""Not really""), indicating some evaluation but lacking depth or detailed reasoning about why the strategy may not have worked effectively. This warrants a moderate score, leaning towards 'Adequate'.

**Final Decision:** The participant mentions a specific strategy (switching after negative outcomes), but the addition of ""Not really"" suggests some inconsistency or reconsideration of this strategy. This indicates a somewhat clear but not fully consistent rule, leading to a higher score in the 'Good' range.

**Confidence:** The participant's expression of doubt (""Not really"") after stating their strategy shows uncertainty about their approach or understanding of the task. This suggests a lower level of confidence, warranting a higher probability in the 'Adequate' range."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows some understanding of the task as they mention the change in the person's behavior in response to losing points. However, the reflection lacks depth and clarity about the full structure or goal of the task, suggesting a moderate comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant indicates a basic strategy of observing changes in behavior due to point loss, but there is no clear plan or hypothesis about how to act on this observation. The response suggests a rudimentary to adequate level of judgment.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the difficulty of the task when changes occur, indicating some level of evaluation. However, there is no deep analysis of whether their strategy was effective or why, leading to a score leaning towards rudimentary to adequate.

**Final Decision:** The reflection lacks a clear description of a consistent rule or decision strategy applied throughout the task. The participant mentions a strategy but does not elaborate on its consistency or finality, suggesting an adequate score at best.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses difficulty and a sense of challenge, which may indicate some doubt about their approach or understanding. There is no strong expression of certainty, leading to a score that suggests low confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant demonstrates a basic understanding of the task's structure and goal, which is to select cards that yield points. The strategy of switching cards after one stops yielding points shows an understanding of the task's reversal nature. The probabilities reflect a good understanding but not a comprehensive one, as the reflection lacks depth about the overall goal beyond immediate point collection.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a clear plan to follow points, which shows a good level of judgment. They decided to stick with a card until it ceased to give points and then switch, indicating a systematic approach. The probabilities lean towards a higher score due to the clear articulation of this plan.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on their strategy working by implicitly indicating that they would switch cards when one stopped yielding points. However, there is minimal explicit reflection on why this strategy worked or didn't, hence the moderate scores.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy by sticking with a card until it stops giving points and then switching. This strategy is clearly articulated, suggesting a higher score, but it lacks a nuanced explanation of any adjustments or considerations beyond the basic rule.

**Confidence:** The participant does not express explicit doubt or uncertainty about their strategy. The brief and straightforward nature of the response, combined with the lack of questioning or alternative strategies, suggests a high level of confidence in their chosen approach, reflected in the higher probabilities towards the upper end of the scale."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's reflection indicates a basic understanding of the task as they mention switching strategies based on a perceived change in ""partners,"" which likely refers to the task conditions. The response suggests some grasp of the task's dynamic nature, but lacks depth in explaining the task structure or rules explicitly.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy formulation is implied rather than explicitly detailed. They mention switching strategies based on a feeling, which shows some level of planning or hypothesis but lacks a clear, structured approach. This suggests a moderate level of judgment used during the task.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their strategy by indicating a switch based on their perception of changes. However, there is no detailed analysis or reasoning about why they believed the strategy worked or didn't, leading to a moderate score.

**Final Decision:** The participant mentions keeping the same strategy throughout, which indicates a decision rule they applied consistently. However, the contradiction in the response (first mentioning a switch, then stating no switch) suggests some confusion or lack of clarity, but ultimately leans towards a consistent strategy.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their approach is not strongly articulated. The use of a casual tone (""No, not really"") and the contradictory statements indicate some uncertainty or casualness about their understanding and strategy application. This leads to a moderate score in confidence, as the participant does not express strong certainty or doubt."

**Rationale:**
- **Comprehension:** The participant's reflection is minimal and vague, indicating a rudimentary understanding of the task dynamics (""some seemed to go in spurts""). There is a slight indication that they noticed patterns in the task, but no clear understanding of rules or goals is expressed.
- **Judgment:** The reflection suggests a minimal level of planning or hypothesis formation, as implied by the observation of ""spurts,"" which might indicate some level of strategy consideration. However, the lack of detail suggests a low level of judgment.
- **Evaluation:** The participant's statement hints at a basic reflection on the task's outcomes (""a bit""), suggesting they might have evaluated their strategy to some extent. However, the evaluation is not detailed or thorough.
- **Final Decision:** The reflection does not clearly describe any consistent rule or decision strategy, only a vague hint at noticing something about the task. This suggests a rudimentary level of decision-making.
- **Confidence:** The participant's expression (""a bit"") implies uncertainty and a lack of confidence in their understanding or strategy. The reflection does not convey strong certainty or doubt, leaning more towards uncertainty."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows an understanding of the task's feedback mechanism (switching after 2 negatives), indicating some comprehension but not a deep understanding of the entire task structure or goals. The probability leans towards ""Adequate"" as the participant grasps part of the task dynamics.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of switching after receiving two negative outcomes suggests a planned approach, reflecting a hypothesis about how to act. The probabilities are higher for ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"" as this shows clear and somewhat sophisticated planning.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's reflection lacks a detailed evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness beyond the immediate response to negative outcomes. The probabilities are distributed more towards ""Rudimentary"" and ""Adequate"" due to minimal reflection on the strategy's success or failure.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule (switching after 2 negatives), which they applied throughout the task. This is a clear decision strategy, meriting higher probabilities for ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"".
- **Confidence**: The participant does not express explicit confidence or doubt about their strategy; however, the use of a consistent rule suggests some level of confidence.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant clearly understood the task rules and goals, as evidenced by their strategy of sticking with a ""good"" option until it changed. The reflection shows a good grasp of the task structure, hence the high probability towards scores 4 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a clear hypothesis about how to act, which was to stick with a good option until it went bad. This shows a well-thought-out plan based on their understanding of the task dynamics, justifying higher scores in this dimension.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflected on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting it was more productive than guessing, especially with increased switching. This indicates a good level of self-assessment and understanding of strategy effectiveness, leading to higher scores in evaluation.

**Final Decision:** The participant described a consistent rule or decision strategy, which was to stick with a good option until it changed. This strategy was applied throughout the task, indicating a high level of consistency and clarity in their final decision-making process.

**Confidence:** The participant expressed a clear and confident understanding of their approach, as seen in their explanation of sticking with a strategy that proved productive. This confidence in their strategy, despite the task's complexity, supports higher scores in this dimension."

**Rationale:**  
- **Comprehension:** The participant's response ""once it was lower"" suggests a minimal, vague understanding of some aspect of the task, possibly referring to a decrease in reward or performance. However, the response lacks clarity and depth, indicating a rudimentary comprehension at best.
- **Judgment:** The response does not clearly articulate any hypothesis or plan regarding how to approach the task. The phrase ""once it was lower"" does not convey a strategic decision-making process, leading to a high probability of an absent score.
- **Evaluation:** There is no evidence that the participant reflected on the effectiveness of their strategy or the reasons behind their task performance. The response lacks any evaluative content, suggesting an absence of this dimension.
- **Final Decision:** The participant does not describe any consistent rule or decision strategy applied during the task. The response is too brief and lacks any substantive content related to a final decision-making process.
- **Confidence:** The participant's response does not explicitly express certainty or doubt about their approach or understanding. The brevity and ambiguity of the response suggest a lack of confidence, but with a slight chance that the participant might have some implicit, albeit unclear, confidence in their understanding."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows an understanding of the task's basic mechanics (clicking for positive points) and the need to switch when rewards change. The response suggests a moderate understanding but lacks depth in explaining the task's structure or goals, hence a higher probability towards a score of 3.

**Judgment:** The participant indicates a simple plan of action (clicking on rewarding options) and a basic hypothesis (switch when no longer rewarded). This shows some judgment but not a sophisticated strategy, leading to a higher probability for a score of 2 or 3.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their strategy (""until they didn't""), indicating some evaluation but not a deep analysis of why strategies worked or failed. This warrants a higher probability for a score of 2.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule (switching after failure to gain points), which shows some clarity in their decision-making process. This suggests a score leaning towards 3, indicating a clear but not highly sophisticated decision strategy.

**Confidence:** The participant does not express strong certainty or doubt about their approach; the language used (""I didn't really have a set strategy"") implies some uncertainty. This leads to a higher probability for a score of 2, indicating moderate confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant clearly understood the task rules and structure, as evidenced by their ability to describe the reward system and their response to it. The reflection shows a good grasp of the task's goal, which was to maximize rewards by identifying and sticking with the most rewarding option until it changes.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a clear plan of action, which was to stick with the option that provided the highest reward until it no longer did so. This strategy is well articulated and shows a good level of planning and hypothesis formation about how to act within the task.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflected on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the frequency of reward changes and adjusting their approach slightly by ""biting the bullet"" on a less rewarding option to test its potential change. This shows a thoughtful evaluation of their strategy's effectiveness and an understanding of the task dynamics.

**Final Decision:** The participant described a consistent rule or decision strategy, which was to follow the highest reward until it shifts and then to adapt by testing other options. This strategy was maintained throughout the task with minor adjustments, indicating a strong and clear final decision-making process.

**Confidence:** The participant expressed a high level of certainty in their approach, sticking to their strategy throughout the task and making only minor adjustments based on their observations. This shows confidence in their understanding and strategy, despite the probabilistic nature of the task."

- **Comprehension**: The participant's brief mention of a strategy (""counting"") suggests some understanding of the task's demands, but the lack of detail about the task structure or goals limits the score. The probabilities reflect an adequate understanding with some clarity.
- **Judgment**: The participant indicates forming a plan (""tried counting""), showing some judgment in approaching the task. The probabilities lean towards an adequate score, acknowledging the presence of a strategy but lacking depth in strategic planning.
- **Evaluation**: The phrase ""somewhat worked"" indicates a basic level of reflection on the strategy's effectiveness, but the lack of deeper analysis or reasons for the strategy's performance results in a score leaning towards rudimentary to adequate.
- **Final Decision**: The participant's brief response does not clearly articulate a consistent rule or decision strategy used throughout the task, other than the initial attempt at counting. The probabilities suggest a basic to adequate final decision-making process.
- **Confidence**: The participant's confidence in their approach is not clearly expressed. The use of ""somewhat worked"" and the terse nature of the response (""no"") suggest uncertainty or doubt, leading to probabilities skewed towards rudimentary to adequate confidence levels."

- **Comprehension**: The participant shows some understanding of the task's dynamics by recognizing the need to switch between options based on outcomes. However, the reflection lacks a clear articulation of the overall goal or rules of the task, suggesting a moderate level of comprehension.
- **Judgment**: The participant describes a specific strategy of switching after a negative outcome and then returning, indicating a planned approach. This reflects a good level of judgment in forming a hypothesis about how to act.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by considering the reasons behind the outcomes (e.g., needing a break or having a bad day), showing a good level of evaluation.
- **Final Decision**: The reflection indicates a consistent strategy of returning to a previous option after testing another, suggesting a clear decision rule was applied. This is indicative of a good to exemplary understanding and application of a decision strategy.

**Comprehension:** The participant's reflection shows minimal understanding of the task's structure or goal, indicated by the simple statement of choosing mostly the middle option. There is no evidence of a deeper understanding or articulation of the task rules, hence the high probability for a rudimentary score.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of choosing mostly the middle option suggests some form of decision-making process, albeit simplistic. This indicates a basic hypothesis about the task, leading to a high probability for an adequate score.

**Evaluation:** The participant provides no reflection on whether their strategy was effective or why it might have worked or failed. The response lacks any evaluative content, justifying a high probability for an absent score.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states their consistent choice of the middle option, indicating a clear, though simplistic, decision strategy. This warrants a high probability for a good score, as they describe a consistent rule they applied throughout the task.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and vague response, especially the phrase ""Only a little,"" suggests uncertainty about their strategy's effectiveness or correctness. This supports a high probability for a rudimentary score, reflecting significant doubt about their approach."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows a basic understanding of the task mechanics by describing their actions in response to changes in the game (e.g., switching from a 100 to a -50 reward). The reflection indicates an adequate to good grasp of the task rules and goals, hence the higher probabilities towards the upper end of the scale.
- **Judgment**: The participant describes forming a strategy based on their experiences (switching from random clicking to a more systematic approach). This indicates a transition from a less effective to a more effective strategy, showing good judgment in adapting their approach.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategies, noting that the second strategy ""seemed to work well."" This shows a good level of self-assessment and understanding of strategy effectiveness, warranting a higher score in evaluation.
- **Final Decision**: The participant clearly articulates a consistent rule or decision strategy by the end of the task, sticking to a method that yielded positive results. This shows a good to exemplary level of strategic consistency.
- **Confidence**: The participant expresses a degree of certainty in their approach by stating that the second strategy ""seemed to work well,"" suggesting confidence in their decision-making process. This is reflected in the higher probabilities towards the upper end of the scale."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task by indicating a strategy of sticking with one choice until it fails. This suggests some grasp of the task's reversal nature, but the explanation lacks depth or a clear articulation of the task's full structure or goals. Hence, a higher probability is given to an ""Adequate"" rating.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy formulation (""I'd keep selecting one until it turned negative"") indicates a planned approach, albeit simple. The clarity and simplicity of the plan suggest a good understanding of how to proceed, but it's not sophisticated or deeply reasoned, leaning towards a ""Good"" rating.

**Evaluation:** The participant does not reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy or consider why it might or might not work, which is why a high probability is assigned to an ""Absent"" rating.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states a consistent rule they applied throughout the task (""keep selecting one until it turned negative""), indicating a strong adherence to a chosen strategy. This clarity and consistency in decision-making strategy suggest a higher score towards ""Exemplary.""

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and straightforward response without questioning their approach or indicating any doubt suggests a high level of confidence in their chosen strategy, meriting a high score towards ""Exemplary."""

Rationale:  
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows some understanding of the task by recognizing that sticking to a strategy or switching after failures is part of the task's challenge. The response suggests an adequate grasp but lacks depth in explaining the task's structure or goals, hence a higher probability for scores 2 and 3.
- **Judgment**: The participant's decision to switch partners after two failures indicates a hypothesis about how to act (changing strategy might lead to better outcomes). This shows clear judgment, leaning towards a good expression, thus higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on their strategy by implicitly evaluating its effectiveness (sticking to it despite failures), suggesting some level of strategy assessment. This is more than adequate but not fully comprehensive, leading to a higher score in the 3 range.
- **Final Decision**: The participant clearly states their final decision strategy (sticking to the initial strategy despite failures), which is articulated well enough to score in the higher range, with a slight lean towards an exemplary understanding.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief statement shows a strong commitment to their chosen strategy, indicating a high level of confidence in their decision-making process. This is reflected in the higher probabilities for scores 4 and 3."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's goal (to maximize points) and the structure (choosing among three options). However, the reflection lacks depth in explaining the rules or structure beyond the immediate goal, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.

**Judgment:** The participant describes a strategy of sticking with a choice as long as it yields positive results and switching when it does not. This indicates some level of planning and hypothesis formation, warranting a higher score in ""Good"" due to the clear but not sophisticated strategy explanation.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the outcomes (100 points vs. negative points) and adjusting accordingly. This shows a good level of self-assessment, leading to a higher probability in ""Good"" and some in ""Exemplary"" for the reflection on strategy effectiveness.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule of sticking with a choice that yields positive results, which shows a clear decision strategy. The explanation is straightforward but lacks a sophisticated analysis of why this strategy might be optimal, leading to a higher score in ""Good.""

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their strategy, but the casual tone (""I just kept trying to find the best choice"") suggests some uncertainty. This results in a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score, with some chance of ""Rudimentary"" or ""Good"" due to the implicit expression of confidence through action rather than explicit statement."

Final Decision: [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.4, 0.5]
Confidence: [0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1]

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by indicating a threshold for switching strategies (""losing points more than half the time""). This suggests some comprehension but lacks depth about the overall structure or goal of the task. The probabilities reflect a moderate understanding.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of switching based on a specific condition (""losing points more than half the time"") indicates a planned approach, which is a form of judgment. The clarity and simplicity of the plan suggest a good level of judgment, though not highly sophisticated or detailed.

**Evaluation:** The participant's brief reflection on their strategy's effectiveness (""If I was losing points more than half the time, I switched"") implies some evaluation but lacks depth in analyzing why this strategy was chosen or its effectiveness beyond the immediate results. The probabilities lean towards a good evaluation but not exemplary.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule for decision-making, which is to switch strategies based on performance. This shows a clear final decision strategy, though the reflection does not explore alternative strategies or justify why this was the best approach deeply.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their strategy is not strongly articulated. The use of a semicolon followed by ""Not really"" suggests some doubt or uncertainty about the effectiveness or appropriateness of the strategy. This mixed signal justifies a spread across the scale, with a slight lean towards moderate confidence."

Confidence: [0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]  

**Rationale:**  
The participant's reflection is extremely brief and lacks substantive content across all dimensions of the Metacognitive Prompting framework. The response ""dont use any ; i dont think so"" suggests a minimal or absent understanding of the task, strategy formulation, evaluation of the strategy, decision-making process, and confidence in their approach.

- **Comprehension:** The participant does not demonstrate an understanding of the task rules, structure, or goal. The statement is vague and does not provide evidence of comprehension.
- **Judgment:** There is no clear hypothesis or plan indicated. The participant's statement suggests a lack of strategy use, which implies an absence of judgment regarding how to approach the task.
- **Evaluation:** The participant does not reflect on whether a strategy worked or why, as they indicate not using any strategy.
- **Final Decision:** There is no description of a consistent rule or decision strategy applied, as the participant states they did not use any strategy.
- **Confidence:** The participant expresses uncertainty (""i dont think so""), indicating low confidence in their approach or understanding of the task.

Given the brevity and lack of detail in the reflection, high probabilities are assigned to a score of 0 (Absent) for all dimensions, with a slight possibility of a score of 1 (Rudimentary) due to the minimal expression of doubt or strategy absence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's goal (to increase winnings) and hints at recognizing changes in task conditions (""the other rounds had a different algorithm""). The response suggests more than rudimentary comprehension but lacks depth in fully grasping the task structure or rules, hence the higher probabilities for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant describes a strategy (""selecting the one with a positive score more than once""), indicating some planning and hypothesis formation. The reflection shows a clear judgment process but not a highly sophisticated strategy, leading to higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4, acknowledging some depth in their planning.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the change in algorithms and randomness in other rounds, which shows some evaluation of their approach. The response is thoughtful but not deeply analytical, justifying higher scores in the middle range (2 and 3).

**Final Decision:** The participant mentions a consistent strategy initially but also hints at noticing changes that might have affected their decisions (""much more random choices""). This suggests some adaptability and final decision-making, with moderate clarity, hence the distribution leaning towards scores 2, 3, and 4.

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their strategy or understanding. The use of a semicolon and the phrase ""it seems"" introduces some uncertainty, suggesting a lack of strong confidence. This is reflected in the higher probabilities for scores 2 and 1, indicating moderate to low confidence."

- **Judgment**: The participant formed a clear hypothesis about which players to choose based on their performance, indicating a well-thought-out plan. The reflection shows a strong judgment capability, leaning towards a higher score.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflected on the effectiveness of their strategy by monitoring the performance of players and switching accordingly. This shows a good level of strategy evaluation, deserving a higher score.
- **Final Decision**: The participant described a consistent rule or decision strategy they applied throughout the task, sticking to switching between player 2 and 3 as needed. This clear and consistent strategy justifies a high score.

**Rationale:**  
The participant's reflection, ""Nothing really ; Not really,"" provides minimal to no information across all dimensions of the Metacognitive Prompting framework. 

- **Comprehension:** The response does not indicate any understanding of the task rules, structure, or goals. The participant's use of ""Nothing really"" suggests a lack of engagement or comprehension, leading to a high probability of scoring a 0.
- **Judgment:** There is no evidence of forming any hypothesis or plan about how to act within the task, as indicated by the terse response. This leads to a similarly high probability of scoring a 0.
- **Evaluation:** The participant does not reflect on whether any strategy worked or why, which is critical for scoring in this dimension. The lack of content in the reflection supports a high probability of scoring a 0.
- **Final Decision:** The participant does not describe any consistent rule or decision strategy they applied. The response suggests an absence of strategic thinking or decision-making.
- **Confidence:** The participant does not express any certainty or doubt about their approach or understanding of the task. The minimalistic response leads to interpreting a lack of confidence or any substantive reflection on their confidence level.

Given the extremely brief and non-informative nature of the participant's reflection, the probabilities are heavily weighted towards a score of 0 in all dimensions, reflecting an absence of metacognitive insight as per the provided framework."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's mechanics (clicking for points and switching when not rewarded), indicating some comprehension. The response lacks detailed insight into the full structure or goal beyond immediate rewards, hence the spread leaning towards the higher end but not fully exemplary.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of switching based on reward presence suggests a rudimentary plan or hypothesis about how to act. The clarity of this plan is not deeply articulated, but it is evident, thus a higher probability towards a good score.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by indicating a switch when not rewarded, showing some level of evaluation. However, there is no deep analysis of why this strategy worked or didn't, which prevents the highest scores.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule (switching based on reward feedback), but the strategy is quite basic and lacks sophistication. The response indicates some level of decision-making clarity, hence a higher score towards good and exemplary but not fully sophisticated.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and straightforward statement shows a level of confidence in their approach, albeit not elaborately justified. The simplicity and directness of the statement (""I just kept clicking whoever gave me points then I'd switch when they wouldn't"") suggest a higher confidence, leaning towards good and exemplary."

- **Judgment**: The participant indicates a strategy (""look for patterns that stand out""), showing some form of planning or hypothesis. However, the lack of elaboration or depth in strategy formulation leads to a higher probability for a score of 1 (Rudimentary).

- **Evaluation**: The participant's brief response ""not really"" to whether they switched strategies suggests minimal reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy. This indicates a rudimentary level of evaluation, leading to a higher probability for a score of 1.

- **Final Decision**: The participant does not clearly articulate a consistent rule or decision strategy they ultimately applied, as indicated by the vague responses. This uncertainty in their final approach leads to a higher probability for scores of 1 and 2.

- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of switching after two bad outcomes shows a clear plan or hypothesis about how to act, which is somewhat sophisticated. The probabilities are higher for ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"" as the participant not only formed a plan but also stuck to it consistently.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not explicitly reflect on whether their strategy worked or why, but the mere mention of a consistent strategy implies some level of evaluation. The probabilities are higher for ""Adequate"" and ""Good"" as there is an implicit evaluation in sticking to a strategy.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy they applied, which is to switch after two bad outcomes. This shows a clear decision strategy, leaning towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"".
- **Confidence**: The participant does not express strong certainty or doubt about their approach, as indicated by the simple and straightforward response. The probabilities are higher for ""Adequate"" and ""Rudimentary"" due to the lack of explicit confidence or doubt expressed."

**Rationale:**  
The participant's reflection, ""my instinct ; Yes,"" is extremely brief and lacks depth across all metacognitive dimensions. Here's the breakdown:

- **Comprehension:** The response does not explicitly indicate an understanding of the task rules, structure, or goal. The mention of ""instinct"" suggests some level of engagement, but it's too vague to assess a deep understanding, hence a high probability for a score of 0.
  
- **Judgment:** There is no clear evidence of forming a hypothesis or plan about how to act, other than a possible implication that the participant relied on instinct. This provides minimal insight, leading to a high probability for a score of 0.
  
- **Evaluation:** The participant does not reflect on whether their strategy worked or why, which is critical for this dimension. The response lacks any evaluative content, thus scoring predominantly towards 0.
  
- **Final Decision:** The response does not describe a consistent rule or decision strategy applied by the participant. ""Yes"" could imply some decision was made, but without context or explanation, it remains too ambiguous, resulting in a high score towards 0.
  
- **Confidence:** While ""Yes"" might indicate some level of confidence, the overall lack of context and explanation about what this confidence pertains to makes it difficult to score higher. The response leans heavily towards a lower score due to insufficient evidence of expressed certainty or doubt about their approach or understanding.

Overall, the reflection is too brief and lacks the necessary detail to score higher in any metacognitive dimension according to the MP framework."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant shows some understanding of the task rules by mentioning specific conditions related to the partners and their scores. However, the reflection lacks a comprehensive explanation of the overall task structure or goal, suggesting a moderate level of comprehension.

**Judgment:**  
The participant's strategy formulation is evident, as they describe sticking with a specific partner unless a particular negative outcome occurs twice. This indicates a planned approach, leaning towards a good understanding of how to manipulate their choices based on outcomes.

**Evaluation:**  
There is minimal reflection on the effectiveness of the strategy used. The participant mentions outcomes (e.g., ""7 100s in a row""), which suggests some evaluation, but it's not deeply analyzed or critically assessed.

**Final Decision:**  
The participant clearly articulates a decision rule (""Stick with Partner 2 unless there as a -50 twice in a row""), which shows a good level of strategic consistency and final decision-making. This suggests a higher probability of a good to exemplary understanding of applying a consistent rule.

**Confidence:**  
Confidence is somewhat implied through the directive tone (""Stick with Partner 2 unless...""), indicating some level of certainty in their strategy. However, the lack of explicit confidence or doubt about their approach suggests a moderate score."

Rationale: The participant's reflection is extremely brief and lacks depth across most metacognitive dimensions. 

- **Comprehension**: The participant's response suggests a minimal understanding of the task, indicated by the acknowledgment of using ""luck"" as a strategy. This implies some level of understanding but is rudimentary at best.
- **Judgment**: The participant does not describe forming any hypothesis or plan, instead attributing their actions to luck. This suggests an absence of strategic judgment.
- **Evaluation**: There is no reflection on the effectiveness of the strategy or any reasoning about why it might have worked or not, indicating a lack of evaluation.
- **Final Decision**: The participant does not describe any consistent rule or decision strategy, merely stating reliance on luck, which does not constitute a strategic decision-making process.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief and dismissive response (""none. just luck ; no"") shows some level of confidence in their non-strategic approach, though it is not based on a thoughtful or informed process. The slight uncertainty in the tone (""just luck"") suggests they are not fully confident in their approach, leading to a spread in scoring probabilities."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant indicates a basic understanding of the task by mentioning the attempt to identify a pattern and choosing the best player per round. This suggests an adequate grasp but lacks depth in explaining the task structure or rules, hence a higher probability for a score of 2.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of looking for patterns and choosing players shows some planning and hypothesis formation. The clarity in expressing this strategy is somewhat good, leading to a higher probability for a score of 3.
- **Evaluation**: The reflection lacks a detailed assessment of whether the strategy was effective, only mentioning the action taken. There's a moderate expression of evaluation, thus a higher probability for a score of 2.
- **Final Decision**: The participant mentions switching players, indicating some form of decision-making process, but does not elaborate on how decisions were consistently applied or refined. This suggests a more adequate to good understanding, leaning towards a score of 2.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief statement does not strongly convey certainty or doubt about their approach. The expression is somewhat vague, leading to a higher probability for a score of 2, indicating moderate confidence."

- **Comprehension**: The response suggests minimal understanding of the task, indicated by the word ""focus,"" but does not elaborate on the rules, structure, or goals of the task. Hence, a high probability is assigned to a score of 0.
- **Judgment**: The reflection does not clearly indicate any hypothesis or plan formation, other than a possible intent to focus. The response is too vague to score higher, leading to a high probability for a score of 0.
- **Evaluation**: There is no evidence of reflection on the effectiveness or reasoning behind the chosen strategy, justifying a high probability for a score of 0.
- **Final Decision**: The participant does not describe any consistent rule or decision strategy, and the response ""no"" is too ambiguous to infer a clear strategy, leading to a high probability for a score of 0.
- **Confidence**: The participant's confidence in their approach or understanding cannot be inferred confidently from the response. The use of ""no"" might suggest some doubt, but this is speculative, hence a slightly lower but still dominant probability for a score of 0.

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows an understanding of the task's basic mechanics, as they mention using guidance on which cards scored most often. The response indicates a moderate understanding but lacks depth in explaining the full structure or goal of the task, hence the higher probabilities for scores 2 and 3.
- **Judgment**: The participant describes a strategy of choosing cards based on their initial guidance and then alternating, which shows some planning. However, the strategy is not deeply sophisticated or detailed, leading to a higher probability for a score of 2 or 3.
- **Evaluation**: The participant mentions choosing a card that intentionally took points away to balance the score, indicating some reflection on their strategy's effectiveness. However, there is no deep analysis of why this might be effective or not, leading to a higher score in the middle range.
- **Final Decision**: The participant seems to have stuck with a consistent strategy of alternating between answers, but there is no clear indication that this strategy was refined or adapted based on task performance, justifying a higher score in the middle range.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response indicates a basic understanding of the task as they mention trying to determine which option was better. However, the response lacks depth or detail about the structure or rules of the task, suggesting only a surface-level comprehension. The probabilities reflect a slight leaning towards ""Adequate"" but with significant uncertainty.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of trying to determine the better option implies some form of judgment or planning, albeit very rudimentary. The response does not elaborate on how decisions were made or any specific hypotheses formed, leading to a higher probability for ""Rudimentary"" and some for ""Adequate.""

**Evaluation:** The participant does not reflect on whether their strategy was effective or why it might have worked or failed. The response lacks any evaluative content, justifying a high probability for ""Absent.""

**Final Decision:** The participant's response does not clearly describe a consistent rule or decision strategy applied throughout the task. The mention of trying to determine the better option is vague and does not indicate a clear, consistent strategy, leading to higher probabilities for ""Absent"" and ""Rudimentary.""

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant's reflection indicates a basic understanding of the task's dynamics, particularly the aspect of monitoring outcomes and adjusting based on them. The strategy of switching after two losses suggests an understanding of the task's probabilistic nature, though the reflection lacks depth about the overall goal or structure beyond this rule. Hence, a higher probability is given to scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:**  
The participant's strategy of switching after two consecutive losses shows some planning and hypothesis formation (i.e., that a change might be needed after repeated negative outcomes). This indicates more than rudimentary judgment but lacks a detailed explanation of why this strategy was chosen, leading to a higher score in the middle range.

**Evaluation:**  
The reflection shows minimal evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness. The participant does not elaborate on whether the strategy worked or why, only stating what the strategy was. There is a slight indication of evaluation in the decision to switch, but it's not deeply analyzed, hence a higher score in the middle range.

**Final Decision:**  
The participant clearly states a specific rule used in the task (switching after two losses), which shows a consistent decision strategy. However, the addition of ""; Not really."" introduces some ambiguity, suggesting either a lack of full commitment to the strategy or an adjustment. This warrants a higher score towards the upper end but not full certainty.

**Confidence:**  
The participant's confidence in their strategy is somewhat unclear. The statement ""; Not really."" suggests some doubt or reconsideration of the initially stated strategy. This indicates moderate confidence but with significant uncertainty, leading to a higher probability in the middle scores."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a good understanding of the task's goal and structure, as they describe sticking with the option that provided the highest value and switching when it turned negative. This indicates a clear grasp of the task dynamics. The probabilities reflect a strong comprehension, leaning towards exemplary.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy formulation is clear and well-articulated, suggesting a high level of judgment in planning their actions. They had a clear hypothesis about sticking with the highest value option, which is a sophisticated approach to the task. The high probabilities for scores 3 and 4 reflect this strong judgment.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on their strategy's effectiveness to some extent by mentioning the switch when the value turned negative, but there is minimal depth in analyzing why this strategy worked or didn't work beyond the immediate outcomes. This warrants a moderate score, with a slight lean towards a good evaluation.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy throughout the task, indicating a good final decision-making process. They did not switch strategies, reinforcing the consistency of their approach. The probabilities are skewed towards higher scores, reflecting a well-defined decision strategy.

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt, but the clarity and consistency in their strategy suggest a level of confidence in their approach. The probabilities are distributed with a lean towards higher scores, indicating a reasonable level of confidence inferred from their strategic consistency and clarity."

**Rationale:**
- **Comprehension:** The participant's statement ""I just focused on finding the positive numbers"" suggests a basic understanding of the task's goal (to identify beneficial choices), but lacks depth in explaining the structure or rules of the task. The probability distribution reflects a dominant score of 2 (Adequate) because the participant shows some understanding but not in-depth.
- **Judgment:** The participant's strategy of focusing on positive numbers indicates a plan or hypothesis about how to act. However, the reflection lacks detail on how this strategy was formulated or adapted, leading to a higher probability for a score of 2 (Adequate).
- **Evaluation:** The participant did not reflect on whether their strategy worked or why, as indicated by the brief response and the direct ""No"" to the question about switching strategies. This suggests a lack of evaluation, justifying a high probability for a score of 0 (Absent).
- **Final Decision:** The participant seems to have stuck with their initial strategy throughout the task, as indicated by the ""No"" in response to switching strategies.

- **Confidence:** The participant's brief and somewhat dismissive response (""I just focused on finding the positive numbers. ; No"") implies a lack of expressed confidence or doubt about their approach. The high probability for a score of 0 (Absent) reflects this lack of metacognitive confidence expression."

**Comprehension:** The participant clearly understood the task's goal, which was to maximize the score by choosing the best partner. The reflection indicates a good grasp of the task structure and rules, as they identified the partner giving the highest reward and adapted to changes. The high scores in this dimension reflect a strong understanding.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a clear plan: to stick with the partner that provided the highest reward until a change occurred. This strategy shows a good level of planning and hypothesis formation about how to act within the task's framework.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflected on the effectiveness of their strategy by sticking with it throughout the task, indicating they believed it worked. They implicitly evaluated their approach by continuing with it, suggesting a good level of reflection on its success.

**Final Decision:** The participant described a very consistent rule or decision strategy, which was to stick with the highest rewarding partner until a change was necessary. This shows a high level of consistency and clarity in their final decision-making process.

**Confidence:** The participant expressed a high level of certainty in their approach by sticking to their strategy throughout the task and not switching strategies. This indicates a strong confidence in their understanding and the effectiveness of their chosen method."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response indicates a basic understanding of the task's goal, which was to stick with a choice that was winning. The response suggests a grasp of the task's structure but lacks depth in explaining the rules or goals beyond the immediate strategy used. Hence, a higher probability is given to scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a simple plan: continue with the option that was winning. This shows some level of strategic planning, though it is not highly sophisticated. The probabilities lean towards the middle to higher end, reflecting a clear but basic strategy.

**Evaluation:** The participant did reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the point at which the chosen option ""no longer won."" This shows some evaluation but lacks depth regarding why the strategy worked or failed, thus the probabilities are centered around scores 2 and 3.

**Final Decision:** The participant described a consistent rule they applied throughout the task, which was to stick with the winning option until it failed. This decision strategy is clear and somewhat reflective, warranting higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief response does not explicitly express confidence, but the simplicity and straightforwardness of the strategy (""just kept going with the winning partner"") imply a certain level of confidence in the chosen approach. The probabilities are therefore higher for scores 3 and 4, reflecting implicit confidence in their strategy."

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's goal (identifying the option that yields a 100 score). The response indicates a grasp of the task structure but lacks a detailed explanation of the rules or deeper insights into the task's mechanics. The probabilities reflect a good understanding but not an exemplary one.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a clear plan to focus on the option that consistently gave high scores and to switch upon receiving negative scores. This shows a strategic approach, hence the higher probabilities for good and exemplary scores.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by mentioning the switch made after receiving negative scores multiple times. This indicates a good level of self-assessment, leading to higher scores in the good and exemplary range.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent decision-making rule: sticking with a choice that yields positive results and switching after repeated negative outcomes. This shows a clear and somewhat sophisticated strategy, justifying higher scores in the good and exemplary range.

**Confidence:** The participant's expression shows some certainty in their approach but includes a hint of simplicity in the strategy's articulation, suggesting moderate confidence. The probabilities are distributed to reflect some uncertainty but generally good confidence in their strategy."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response indicates a basic understanding of the task's need to switch choices when outcomes change, suggesting some grasp of the task's reversal nature. However, the explanation lacks depth about the overall structure or goal, hence the higher probabilities for scores 1 and 2.

**Judgment:** The participant mentions switching strategies, which implies some form of planning or hypothesis testing. However, the reflection is not detailed or clear about what these strategies were, leading to a higher probability for a score of 1 or 2.

**Evaluation:** The participant briefly reflects on the strategy's effectiveness (""when they started being the wrong choice""), indicating some evaluation. However, the reflection lacks depth or reasoning about why the strategy worked or didn't, justifying a higher score in the lower range.

**Final Decision:** The participant's strategy seems to be reactive rather than based on a consistent rule or decision strategy, as indicated by the phrase ""just switched it up."" This suggests a rudimentary or adequate final decision-making process, leading to higher probabilities for scores 1 and 2.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's brief response suggests a minimal understanding of the task, as they relied on ""intuition"" without elaborating on the task's rules or goals. The probability distribution leans towards a lower score but acknowledges some understanding, as intuition itself implies a basic grasp of task demands.

**Judgment:** The participant's reliance on intuition indicates some form of judgment or decision-making process, albeit implicit and not well-articulated. The distribution reflects uncertainty about the depth of their planning or hypothesis formation.

**Evaluation:** The participant did not reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy or provide reasons for its success or failure. The high probability for a score of 0 reflects the absence of this dimension in their response.

**Final Decision:** The participant's statement does not clearly describe a consistent rule or decision strategy, other than a vague reference to intuition. The distribution suggests uncertainty but leans towards lower scores due to the lack of explicit strategy description.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and casual response (""No, just my intuition"") suggests some level of confidence in their approach, albeit not strongly expressed. The distribution is spread across lower scores, reflecting the minimal expression of confidence."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant's response suggests a basic understanding of the task as they mention trying to get a ""point streak going again."" This indicates some grasp of the task's goal (to maximize points), but lacks depth or sophistication in understanding the rules or structure. Hence, a higher probability is given to a score of 2 (Adequate).
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of searching for a point streak implies a form of hypothesis or plan, though it is not detailed. The response suggests a moderate level of planning, leaning towards a score of 3 (Good) due to the implied ongoing adjustment to maintain the streak.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not provide a clear reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy beyond the brief mention of searching for a point streak. There is minimal evaluation of why this strategy was chosen or its effectiveness, leading to a higher probability for a score of 2 (Adequate).
- **Final Decision**: The participant's strategy seems to be consistent, focusing on maintaining a point streak. The lack of strategy change and the clarity in sticking to this approach suggest a higher score, leaning towards a 4 (Exemplary) as they consistently applied this rule.
- **Confidence**: The participant's confidence in their strategy is not explicitly stated, and the brief response suggests some uncertainty or minimal self-assurance. This is reflected in the higher probabilities for scores of 1 (Rudimentary) and 2 (Adequate)."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows an understanding of the task as involving pattern recognition and prediction. However, the depth of understanding regarding how these patterns relate to the task rules or goals is not fully articulated, suggesting a good but not exemplary grasp.

**Judgment:** The participant indicates a strategy based on counting and predicting changes, which reflects a clear plan of action. The mention of strategy adjustment also suggests a higher level of judgment, as it implies ongoing hypothesis testing and adaptation.

**Evaluation:** The reflection includes a basic evaluation (""The pattern would change""), but lacks depth in analyzing why the strategy worked or didn't work. The participant does not reflect deeply on the effectiveness of the strategy beyond its basic application, leading to a moderate score.

**Final Decision:** The participant seems to have a consistent rule or decision strategy by the end of the task, as indicated by their confidence in predicting changes. However, the lack of detailed explanation prevents the highest score.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses some certainty in their approach (""predict when it will change""), but also implies simplicity and brevity in their confidence. There is no strong indication of doubt, yet the confidence is not robustly supported with detailed reasoning, leading to a moderate score."

- **Evaluation**: The participant does not reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy or provide any reasoning behind their actions, which strongly suggests a score close to 0.
- **Final Decision**: The participant's strategy seems consistent (""just clicked...""), but it's not based on any thoughtful decision-making process. This warrants a higher probability for lower scores.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief and casual response (""no, I just clicked...; not really."") implies uncertainty or a lack of serious engagement with the task, leading to a higher probability of lower scores in confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's goal (maximizing points), but the reflection lacks detailed insight into the structure or rules beyond the scoring. The probabilities reflect a good understanding but not an exemplary one, as the details of task mechanics are not explored deeply.

**Judgment:** The participant clearly formed a strategy based on their goal of maximizing points and made decisions to abandon less successful options. The reflection indicates a plan was in place, and there's some depth in their strategic thinking, especially as they reconsidered their initial approach.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy, particularly noting the potential overreaction to negative scores. This shows a good level of self-assessment and understanding of strategy outcomes, meriting a higher score in evaluation.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a shift in their decision-making process, moving from a quick-switch strategy to a more considered approach. This indicates a good level of strategic consistency once they revised their approach, but it's not fully clear if this was consistently applied thereafter.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses some certainty in their approach initially and later shows thoughtful reconsideration. This mixed expression of confidence and doubt suggests a moderate to good level of confidence in their understanding and strategy, but not complete certainty."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant seems to have a basic understanding of the task as they describe a strategy of switching ""persons"" after a negative outcome. However, the explanation lacks depth about the overall goal or rules of the task, suggesting some comprehension but not a sophisticated understanding. Hence, a higher probability is given to scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan (switching after a negative outcome), which shows some judgment. However, the strategy is not elaborated upon deeply, and there's no indication of anticipating outcomes or adjusting the plan proactively. Thus, scores 2 and 3 are more probable, with a slight chance for a higher score if interpreted as a simple but effective plan.

**Evaluation:** The participant does reflect minimally on their strategy by indicating a switch after a negative outcome, but there's no deep analysis of why this strategy was chosen or its effectiveness beyond the immediate response. This warrants a moderate score in evaluation, leaning towards the middle of the scale.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule (switching after a negative outcome), but the strategy is quite basic and not elaborated upon. There's some indication of a decision strategy, but it's not detailed, leading to a higher probability for score 2 and a moderate chance for score 3.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their strategy is unclear and seems low, as indicated by the vague and brief explanation (""A little bit""). This suggests some uncertainty, leading to higher probabilities for lower scores in this dimension."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's statement implies some understanding of the task as they recognized the need for varying strategies, suggesting they grasped the task's dynamic nature. However, the lack of specific details about the task rules or goals limits the score to a mix of ""Adequate"" and ""Good,"" with a slight possibility of ""Exemplary"" due to the implicit understanding shown by strategy variation.

**Judgment:** The participant indicates that they did form strategies, albeit varied ones, which shows some level of planning or hypothesis formation. The reflection lacks depth about how these strategies were formed or based on what judgments, leading to a higher probability for ""Adequate.""

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their strategies by acknowledging the variation, but does not delve into why certain strategies were chosen or their outcomes. This warrants a higher score in ""Rudimentary"" and ""Adequate.""

**Final Decision:** The participant admits to changing strategies frequently, which suggests a lack of a consistent final decision strategy. This is reflected in higher probabilities for ""Absent"" and ""Rudimentary.""

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by describing a specific action (switching partners after receiving negative feedback). The response indicates a grasp of the task structure but lacks depth in explaining the overall goal or rules beyond immediate actions. Hence, a higher probability is given to scores indicating adequate to good comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of switching after negative feedback suggests some level of planning or hypothesis formation (i.e., expecting better outcomes from switching after consistent negative results). The clarity of this plan is somewhat evident, but not deeply elaborated, leading to a higher score in the good range.

**Evaluation:** The participant briefly mentions the outcome that triggers a strategy switch but does not deeply reflect on the effectiveness or reasons behind the strategy's success or failure. This warrants a moderate score, leaning towards adequate, as there is some minimal reflection.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states a consistent rule used during the task (switching after several negative outcomes), which shows a definite decision strategy. The clarity and consistency in this strategy are well articulated, justifying a higher score in the good to exemplary range.

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their strategy. However, the straightforward and unambiguous statement of their strategy suggests a level of confidence in their approach, meriting a higher score towards good and exemplary, albeit with some uncertainty due to the lack of explicit confidence expression."

- **Evaluation:** The participant reflected on the effectiveness of their strategy by recognizing the need to change it upon the emergence of a new pattern. This shows a good level of self-evaluation, meriting a higher score.
- **Final Decision:** The participant described a consistent rule-based strategy (sticking with a partner until three negative outcomes), and also mentioned adapting this strategy, which shows a clear decision-making process. The scores are therefore higher towards 4.
- **Confidence:** The participant expressed some level of certainty in their approach by sticking to a rule until it no longer worked, and then confidently switching strategies. However, there is less explicit expression of confidence compared to other dimensions, hence a slightly lower score towards 4."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's reflection shows some understanding of the task as they mention changing card points, which implies a grasp of the task's mechanics. However, the expression is vague and lacks depth, suggesting only a moderate comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant indicates a strategy change (""Yes, change the card points""), which shows some level of planning or hypothesis formation. However, the explanation is minimal and lacks clarity, leading to a higher probability for lower scores.

**Evaluation:** The participant's statement ""I have confuse it"" suggests some reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy, albeit expressed unclearly and with confusion. This indicates a rudimentary to adequate level of evaluation.

**Final Decision:** The reflection includes a mention of a strategy change but does not clearly articulate a consistent rule or decision strategy applied throughout the task. The response is somewhat unclear, leading to moderate scores.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses confusion and uncertainty about their strategy (""I have confuse it""), which indicates a lack of confidence in their approach. The reflection does not convey strong certainty or self-assuredness, resulting in higher probabilities for lower scores."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows some understanding of the task rules by mentioning the outcomes that led to a strategy change. However, the depth of understanding the overall goal or structure of the task isn't fully clear, hence a higher probability in the middle range.

**Judgment:** The participant explicitly mentions a decision rule based on the outcomes of their choices, indicating some level of planning or hypothesis formation. The clarity and thoughtfulness in expressing this rule suggest a higher score towards the good range.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly suggesting it was based on the outcomes they experienced. However, there is no deep analysis of why this strategy was chosen or its effectiveness beyond the immediate results, leading to a moderate score.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule they applied based on specific outcomes, which shows some level of decision-making strategy. The clarity is moderate, and while there is some indication of a consistent approach, the depth of strategic insight is not fully developed.

**Confidence:** The participant does not express strong certainty or doubt about their approach; the response is somewhat neutral and factual. This suggests a moderate level of confidence, neither fully assured nor particularly doubtful, leading to a balanced distribution in the middle scores."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant shows an understanding of the task by identifying a ""partner"" (likely a choice in the task) that was most helpful, indicating they grasped the goal of finding beneficial options. However, the reflection lacks depth about the overall structure or rules of the task, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.

**Judgment:**  
The participant formed a plan to stick with the most helpful option, which shows some level of strategic planning. The clarity of this plan is somewhat evident, but not deeply elaborated, leading to a higher score in ""Good.""

**Evaluation:**  
The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the need to change when the chosen option was no longer beneficial. This shows a good level of self-evaluation, but lacks a detailed analysis of why the strategy worked or failed initially, hence a higher score in ""Good.""

**Final Decision:**  
The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy by sticking with the most helpful option until it ceased to be beneficial. This strategy is clear, but the reflection could benefit from more detail on how the final decision was applied consistently, leading to a higher probability for ""Good"" and ""Exemplary.""

**Confidence:**  
The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their approach. However, the straightforward statement of their strategy and decision to change implies a level of confidence in understanding and applying their strategy, leading to higher scores in ""Good"" and ""Exemplary."""

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response indicates a basic understanding of the task's goal (to choose the option giving the most points). However, the response lacks depth in explaining the structure or rules beyond the immediate goal, suggesting a score leaning towards ""Adequate.""

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of choosing the ""person giving the most points"" implies a simple but clear plan. The response shows some judgment but lacks sophistication or a detailed hypothesis about how different choices might affect outcomes, thus a higher score in ""Good"" seems appropriate.

**Evaluation:** The participant did not reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy or consider why it might or might not have worked, as indicated by the terse ""no"" in response to strategy switching. This suggests a high probability for a low score in ""Evaluation.""

**Final Decision:** The participant stuck with a consistent strategy throughout the task, as indicated by the lack of strategy switching. This suggests a clear rule or decision strategy was applied, warranting a higher score in ""Final Decision.""

**Confidence:** The participant's brief response does not strongly convey confidence or doubt; it is somewhat neutral. The simplicity and brevity of the answer, combined with the lack of explicit confidence or questioning, suggest a middle range score leaning towards ""Adequate."""

- **Comprehension**: The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's goal (to gain points) and the mechanics (switching choices when not gaining points). The response is somewhat clear but lacks depth, hence a higher probability for a score of 2.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of choosing based on reward feedback indicates some planning or hypothesis formation, but it's not detailed or sophisticated. A score of 3 is more probable as they clearly had a plan, though it was simple.
- **Evaluation**: The participant briefly reflects on their strategy's effectiveness (""moved on to a different one when it didn't give me points""), but there's minimal depth or analysis of why this strategy was chosen or its effectiveness beyond the immediate outcome.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response indicates a basic understanding of the task as they mention bouncing between what seemed reliable, suggesting some grasp of the need to switch choices based on outcomes. However, the response lacks depth or explicit acknowledgment of task rules or goals, hence the higher probabilities for scores 1 and 2.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of switching between reliable options implies some level of planning or hypothesis formation, but it is not articulated clearly or in detail. This warrants a higher probability for a score of 1 or 2, indicating rudimentary to adequate judgment.

**Evaluation:** The participant does not reflect on whether their strategy was effective or why it might have been so. The response ""No"" to the question about switching strategies does not pertain directly to evaluation of effectiveness, leading to a high probability for a score of 0.

**Final Decision:** The participant mentions a consistent approach of bouncing between options that seemed reliable, but this strategy is not described in a detailed or sophisticated manner. This suggests a rudimentary to adequate final decision-making process, hence the higher probabilities for scores 1 and 2.

**Comprehension:** The participant's reflection indicates a basic understanding of the task as they mention taking risks and sticking to safer guesses, suggesting they grasped the probabilistic nature of the task. However, the depth of understanding isn't fully clear, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of balancing risk and safety implies some level of planning or hypothesis about how to act. The reflection shows a moderate level of judgment, leaning towards a ""Good"" score due to the implied strategic thinking.

**Judgment:** The participant mentions switching strategies, which implies some form of planning or hypothesis testing. However, the details are minimal and not elaborated, leading to a higher probability for a score of 1, with some possibility for a score of 2.

**Evaluation:** The response shows almost no reflection on the effectiveness of the strategies used or reasons for their success or failure. The participant simply states a change in strategy without evaluating its impact, justifying a high probability for a score of 0.

**Final Decision:** The participant indicates a decision to switch strategies, but does not describe a consistent rule or decision strategy that was ultimately applied. The response suggests some decision-making but lacks clarity and consistency, leading to higher probabilities for scores 1 and 2.

**Confidence:** The participant's response shows significant uncertainty and lack of confidence in their approach, as indicated by the terse and unclear reflection. This justifies a high probability for a score of 0, with some chance for a score of 1."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a clear understanding of the task's structure and goal by focusing on the ""middle partner"" due to consistent results. The reflection indicates a grasp of the task rules, though not deeply detailed, hence the higher probabilities towards the upper end of the scale.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan to stick with the middle partner, which shows some level of strategic thinking. The reflection lacks a detailed hypothesis but shows a clear decision-making process, leading to a higher score in judgment.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the strategy's effectiveness by noting the consistency of the middle partner and their decision to return to this choice after trying others. This shows a good level of self-evaluation, justifying higher scores in this dimension.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy by repeatedly choosing the middle partner, even after exploring other options. This indicates a strong adherence to a chosen strategy, meriting a higher score in the final decision.

**Confidence:** The participant's repeated choice and return to the middle partner, despite some deviations, suggest a level of confidence in this strategy. The reflection, however, does not explicitly express certainty, which is why the highest probabilities are not at the maximum."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's rules by indicating a response to repeated negative outcomes (-50). The response suggests they grasped the need to switch choices based on outcomes, indicating more than rudimentary comprehension but not fully sophisticated insight. Hence, a higher probability is given to scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant explicitly mentions a decision rule (switching choices after several negative outcomes), which reflects some planning and hypothesis formation. The clarity and directness of this strategy suggest good judgment, leaning towards scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant's strategy implies an evaluation process (recognizing repeated negative outcomes as a cue to change behavior), but lacks depth in explaining why this strategy might be effective beyond the immediate losses. Thus, scores 2, 3, and 4 are considered, with a higher likelihood for 3.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states a consistent decision rule they applied (""If I got -50 several times in a row I would try a new choice""), which is a direct and clear strategy. This suggests a strong final decision-making process, justifying higher scores in 3 and 4.

**Confidence:** The participant does not express explicit confidence or doubt about their strategy; however, the straightforward nature of their response and the lack of questioning or uncertainty in their strategy suggest a higher level of confidence. Thus, scores 3 and 4 are more probable."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows an understanding of the task rules by recognizing the negative impact of choosing a deck with a high frequency of -50 values. The response indicates a grasp of the task's probabilistic nature and the goal of avoiding losses, hence the higher scores towards the upper end.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy to switch decks after observing consistent negative outcomes suggests a clear plan or hypothesis about how to act under certain conditions. This reflects a good level of judgment, warranting higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly suggesting that switching decks could potentially lead to better outcomes, indicating some level of strategy evaluation. This justifies a higher score in the good to exemplary range.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (switching decks after repeated negative outcomes), which shows a clear decision-making process. This supports higher scores in the good to exemplary range.
- **Confidence**: The participant's response, while brief, does not express doubt about their approach. The use of a semicolon followed by a definitive ""No."" suggests a level of certainty about not changing the strategy further, supporting higher scores in confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's brief response indicates some understanding of the task's mechanics (switching upon a negative outcome), but lacks depth in explaining the task's structure or goals. The probability distribution reflects an adequate to good understanding, with some room for more detailed comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of switching immediately after a negative outcome suggests a clear plan or hypothesis about how to approach the task. The distribution leans towards a good score, acknowledging the presence of a strategic decision, though not elaborated in great detail.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy is minimal and implicit, indicated only by their continued use of the strategy without modification. The probabilities suggest an adequate level of reflection, with some uncertainty due to the brevity of the response.

**Final Decision:** The participant indicates a consistent rule or decision strategy (switching after a negative outcome) and sticks to it throughout the task, as implied by their brief ""no"" to changing strategies. The distribution is skewed towards a good to exemplary understanding, recognizing the clarity of the applied rule.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their strategy is implied by the brevity and directness of their response, though not explicitly stated. The distribution suggests a moderate to high level of confidence, inferred from the lack of strategy change and the straightforward nature of the response."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's statement indicates some understanding of the task as they recognized the need to search for patterns, which is central to a probabilistic reversal learning task. The response suggests a moderate to good grasp of the task's structure, hence the distribution leaning towards higher scores.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy to ""find patterns"" implies a planned approach to the task, showing some level of judgment. The continuous search for patterns suggests an ongoing hypothesis testing, which is a higher level of cognitive engagement, thus the probability is skewed towards higher scores.

**Evaluation:** The reflection lacks a clear assessment of whether the strategy was effective, only stating what was done without reflecting on its success or reasons for outcomes. This suggests an adequate to rudimentary level of evaluation, leading to a balanced distribution across the lower and middle scores.

**Final Decision:** The participant's consistent approach (""continuously searched for patterns"") indicates a clear decision strategy was applied throughout the task. This consistency suggests a good to exemplary understanding and application of a decision rule, hence the higher scores.

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence, but the repeated affirmation of their strategy (""No, I continuously searched for patterns"") implies a certain level of confidence in their chosen approach. This is interpreted as moderate to high confidence, reflected in the higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's reflection suggests a basic understanding of the task's structure, as they mention giving a ""second chance"" which implies some grasp of the task's probabilistic nature and the need for decision-making. However, the reflection lacks depth in explaining the rules or goals of the task, hence the higher probabilities for lower scores.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of giving a ""second chance"" indicates some form of planning or hypothesis about how to act, but the reflection is brief and lacks detail about why this strategy was chosen or its expected outcomes. This warrants a higher probability for a score of 1 or 2.

**Evaluation:** The participant does not provide a clear reflection on whether their strategy worked or why, which suggests a rudimentary level of evaluation. The reflection lacks depth in analyzing the effectiveness of the strategy, leading to higher probabilities for lower scores.

**Final Decision:** The participant mentions a specific action (""gave a partner a second chance then moved on""), which indicates some form of decision strategy. However, the lack of detail and rationale behind this decision leads to moderate probabilities across the middle of the scale.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and somewhat ambiguous reflection (""No i didn't really"") on not changing strategies suggests uncertainty about their approach or understanding of the task. This warrants a distribution leaning towards lower scores, reflecting doubt and minimal expression of confidence."

However, the response lacks depth in explaining the overall goal or structure of the task, hence a higher probability for a score of 2 and 3.
- **Judgment**: The participant clearly states a decision rule based on the outcomes they experienced, which shows a planned approach. The clarity and specificity of the rule suggest a good level of judgment, leaning towards higher scores.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly suggesting it was their consistent approach throughout the task. They do not explicitly state the outcomes of this strategy, but the implication is there, warranting a higher score but not the highest due to lack of detailed analysis.
- **Final Decision**: The participant indicates a clear and consistent decision strategy (""stuck with that one""), which shows a strong final decision-making process. The response, while brief, is decisive, justifying higher scores.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief response shows some level of confidence, particularly in sticking with their strategy despite negative outcomes.

- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy formulation (""stayed on one partner until that partner gave a negative score"") shows a planned approach, suggesting a clear judgment about how to proceed based on the outcomes received. This indicates a good level of judgment, though not fully sophisticated or detailed.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not explicitly reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy beyond the immediate reaction to switch after a negative score. There's some evaluation implied but not deeply analyzed or critiqued.
- **Final Decision**: The participant clearly states a consistent rule they applied throughout the task (""stayed on one partner until that partner gave a negative score""), which shows a strong adherence to a chosen strategy, justifying a high score in this dimension.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's reflection suggests a basic understanding of the task's feedback mechanism (""only switched when one seemed to offer a negative effect""), indicating some grasp of the task structure. However, the lack of detail about the task rules or goals limits the score to a higher probability of 2 (Adequate).

**Judgment:** The participant's statement about switching strategies based on negative effects implies some form of hypothesis or plan formation, albeit simplistic and reactive rather than proactive. This warrants a higher probability of scoring a 2 (Adequate), with some possibility of a 1 (Rudimentary) due to the minimal detail provided.

**Evaluation:** The reflection includes a basic evaluation (""only switched when one seemed to offer a negative effect""), indicating that the participant did reflect on the effectiveness of their actions to some extent. This supports a higher probability of scoring a 2 (Adequate), with a slight chance for a 3 (Good) if interpreted as a thoughtful, albeit brief, strategy assessment.

**Final Decision:** The participant mentions a decision strategy of switching based on negative outcomes, which is a consistent rule but not elaborated upon. This suggests a balance between scores 1 (Rudimentary) and 2 (Adequate), with a slight possibility for a 3 (Good) if the simplicity of the strategy is seen as a deliberate choice.

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their approach, leading to uncertainty in this dimension. The reflection hints at some level of confidence in their reactive strategy, but it's not strongly articulated, suggesting a higher probability for scores 1 (Rudimentary) and 2 (Adequate)."

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of sticking with a deck until it changes shows a clear plan or hypothesis about how to approach the task. The response suggests a thoughtful decision-making process, leaning towards a higher score.

**Evaluation:** The participant does not explicitly reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy beyond a simple ""no"" when asked if they switched strategies. This suggests minimal evaluation of the strategy's success or failure, hence the moderate scores.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states their decision strategy (staying with a positive deck until it changes) and indicates they did not switch strategies. This shows a consistent rule was applied, deserving a higher score.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief response does not explicitly convey confidence, but the decisiveness in sticking to a single strategy and not switching suggests some level of confidence in their chosen approach. The probabilities reflect moderate to high confidence."

- **Comprehension**: The participant seems to have a basic understanding of the task dynamics, as indicated by their recognition that the leader in points changed over time. This suggests some grasp of the task's probabilistic nature and the shifting advantages, warranting a higher probability towards scores 3 and 4.
- **Judgment**: The reflection lacks a clear description of a specific strategy or hypothesis about how to approach the task, leading to higher probabilities for lower scores. The participant does not explicitly mention forming a plan or hypothesis.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's statement implies a minimal reflection on the task's outcome (""the person that had the most points would change""), but does not delve into evaluating the effectiveness of their strategy or decisions, thus higher probabilities are assigned to lower scores.
- **Final Decision**: The participant does not clearly articulate a consistent decision strategy used throughout the task. The reflection suggests some awareness but lacks detail, leading to a balanced distribution across the middle scores.
- **Confidence**: The participant's statement shows some level of uncertainty and lack of confidence in understanding or controlling the task outcomes, as they only describe an observation rather than a confident assertion or strategy, leading to higher probabilities in the lower and middle scores."

Rationale: The participant's reflection, ""none was needed specifically; Can not recall,"" provides minimal insight into their understanding or approach to the task. This response suggests a lack of engagement or recall regarding the task, which affects all dimensions negatively.

- **Comprehension**: The statement implies a lack of engagement or memory of the task rules or structure, leading to a high probability of a low score.
- **Judgment**: There is no evidence of forming any hypothesis or plan, as the participant states no strategy was specifically needed.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not reflect on the effectiveness of a strategy or its outcomes, indicating a lack of evaluation.
- **Final Decision**: There is no description of any consistent rule or decision strategy applied, as the participant does not recall using any strategy.

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows some understanding of the task by sticking to an initial choice until it fails, indicating they grasped the task's trial-and-error nature. However, the depth of understanding the overall structure or goal isn't fully articulated, hence the spread leaning towards ""Adequate"" and ""Good"".
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy formulation is evident as they decided to stick with an initial choice until proven otherwise. This shows a clear plan of action, thus scoring higher in this dimension.
- **Evaluation**: The participant briefly reflects on the strategy's effectiveness by noting the switch when the choice became ""unreliable."" This shows some evaluation but lacks depth about why the strategy worked or didn't, hence a peak at ""Adequate.""
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule they applied (sticking with the initial choice until failure), which is a clear decision strategy. The response leans towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"" as it shows a rational and minimal strategy change.
- **Confidence**: The participant's confidence in their strategy is not explicitly stated, and the terse response suggests some uncertainty or lack of reflection on their confidence level. The distribution suggests uncertainty, peaking at ""Adequate."""

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by describing a specific condition for switching strategies. The mention of ""-50 results"" suggests an understanding of the task's feedback mechanism, though it's not entirely clear. The response indicates more than rudimentary comprehension but lacks depth for a higher score.

**Judgment:** The participant clearly formed a hypothesis about how to act, initially choosing to stick with one option and later adjusting to a more systematic approach based on the outcomes. This shows a progression in their planning, meriting a score leaning towards 'Good'.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their initial strategy and why they switched, indicating some evaluation. However, the depth of this reflection is not fully developed, suggesting a score between 'Adequate' and 'Good'.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule they applied after switching strategies, which shows a clear decision-making process. The explanation is somewhat detailed, suggesting a higher score in this dimension.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their approach is implied but not explicitly stated. They mention a switch in strategy, which might indicate some doubt about the initial approach. The response suggests moderate confidence, warranting a score around 'Adequate'."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant mentions knowing the ""optimal strategy,"" which suggests some understanding of the task's structure or goal. However, the statement is vague and lacks detail about the specific comprehension of the task rules. The probabilities reflect a moderate understanding but not in-depth.

**Judgment:** The participant's mention of ""gambling strategies"" and knowledge of programming implies some form of hypothesis or plan about how to act. However, the reflection lacks detail on how these strategies were applied or adapted to the task, leading to a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.

**Evaluation:** The participant does not reflect on whether their strategy worked or why, leading to a high probability for an ""Absent"" score. There is no mention of assessing the outcomes or reasoning behind the strategy's effectiveness.

**Final Decision:** The statement about knowing the ""optimal strategy"" suggests a consistent rule or decision strategy might have been applied. However, the lack of explicit detail on what this strategy entails or how it was consistently applied throughout the task leads to a higher score in the ""Good"" range, with some probability for ""Exemplary"" due to the implied confidence in their approach.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses a high level of confidence by stating they know the ""optimal strategy."" This suggests a strong belief in their understanding and approach, warranting a higher probability for a ""Good"" to ""Exemplary"" score in this dimension."

**Rationale:**  
The participant's response ""nothing ; no"" provides extremely minimal information and does not explicitly address any of the dimensions outlined in the Metacognitive Prompting (MP) framework. 

- **Comprehension:** The response suggests a lack of engagement or understanding of the task, as indicated by ""nothing."" This implies an absence of comprehension regarding the task rules, structure, or goal.
- **Judgment:** There is no evidence of forming any hypothesis or plan about how to act, as the participant simply states ""nothing.""
- **Evaluation:** The participant does not reflect on whether any strategy worked or why, as they indicate no strategy was used.
- **Final Decision:** The response does not describe any consistent rule or decision strategy applied during the task.
- **Confidence:** The brevity and nature of the response suggest a lack of confidence or perhaps indifference, but it does not explicitly express certainty or doubt about their approach or understanding.

Given the extremely brief and non-informative nature of the response, high probabilities are assigned to a score of 0 across all dimensions, with a slight possibility (0.1) of a score of 1, acknowledging the minimal chance that the participant might have understood but chose not to engage or elaborate."

**Comprehension:** The participant clearly understood the task rules and structure, as evidenced by their methodical approach to testing each classmate and observing patterns. The reflection shows a sophisticated understanding of the task's probabilistic nature, hence the high probability for scores 3 and 4.

**Judgment:** The participant formed hypotheses about classmates' trustworthiness based on observed patterns, indicating a strategic approach to decision-making. The reflection shows thoughtful planning and hypothesis testing, justifying higher scores in this dimension.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflected on the effectiveness of their strategy by observing and reacting to patterns in classmates' behavior. This indicates a good level of self-assessment and understanding of strategy outcomes, supporting higher scores.

**Final Decision:** The participant described a consistent rule or decision strategy by switching based on observed patterns of help from classmates. This shows a clear and consistent decision-making process, meriting a higher score.

**Confidence:** The participant expressed some level of certainty in their approach by sticking to a pattern-based strategy, but also showed some doubt by only sometimes noticing patterns and adjusting accordingly. This mixed expression justifies a balanced distribution across the middle scores."

Rationale: The participant's reflection is extremely brief and lacks clarity and relevance to the task described. It does not provide any insight into their understanding of the task rules, structure, or goals, leading to a high probability of scoring low in the Comprehension dimension. Similarly, there is no evident hypothesis or plan formation, nor any reflection on the strategy's effectiveness, which results in low scores in the Judgment and Evaluation dimensions. The phrase used does not clearly describe a decision strategy related to the task, thus scoring low in the Final Decision dimension. Lastly, the participant does not express any clear confidence or doubt about their approach, resulting in a low score in the Confidence dimension. The probabilities reflect a strong likelihood of minimal to no metacognitive insight across all dimensions."

- **Judgment**: The participant formed a clear plan (not switching before three losses), which shows a good level of judgment. The clarity and specificity of the plan suggest a higher score.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their strategy by sticking to it, implying some level of evaluation but not a deep analysis of why it worked or didn't.
- **Final Decision**: The participant clearly states that they adhered to their initial strategy throughout, indicating a strong final decision-making process.

Confidence: [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6]  

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant shows an understanding of the task's basic mechanics (switching decks when one stops rewarding), but there's no deep insight into the structure or rules beyond the immediate gameplay. The response suggests adequate comprehension with some clarity, hence a higher probability for a score of 2.

**Judgment:**  
The participant describes a simple strategy based on the outcomes of their actions (switching decks when not rewarded), indicating some level of planning or hypothesis formation. The strategy is somewhat clear but lacks depth, suggesting a good score, with a slight possibility of being exemplary due to the straightforward nature of the task.

**Evaluation:**  
The participant's reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy is minimal. They indicate sticking with their strategy without discussing its success or reasons for its effectiveness in depth. This warrants a score leaning towards adequate, with some rudimentary understanding.

**Final Decision:**  
The participant clearly states that they did not switch strategies, indicating a strong adherence to a consistent rule or decision strategy. This response shows a high level of certainty in their final decision-making process, deserving a high score.

**Confidence:**  
The participant's brief statement about sticking with their strategy implies a level of confidence in their approach, although it's not elaborated upon deeply. The confidence is apparent but not discussed in detail, suggesting a score leaning towards good, with a possibility of being exemplary."

Rationale:  
- **Comprehension**: The participant's brief response suggests a basic understanding of the task's goal (to win more), but lacks depth or explicit acknowledgment of task rules or structure. The probability distribution reflects a moderate understanding with some uncertainty about the depth of comprehension.
- **Judgment**: The participant indicates a decision-making process (""stuck to the one that won more""), which shows some planning or hypothesis formation. The distribution leans towards a good understanding, acknowledging some strategy but not a sophisticated or detailed plan.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's reflection lacks a clear assessment of the strategy's effectiveness beyond the outcome (""won more""). There is minimal reflection on why the strategy worked or didn't, hence the higher probabilities for lower scores.
- **Final Decision**: The participant's statement about sticking to a winning option suggests a consistent decision strategy, albeit not elaborated. The distribution reflects a higher probability for a good to exemplary understanding, recognizing the presence of a rule-based approach.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief and somewhat casual response (""; no."") implies some uncertainty or minimal reflection on their confidence in the strategy used. The distribution reflects this uncertainty and lack of explicit confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response indicates a basic understanding of the task's immediate mechanics (responding to which option gave points) but lacks depth in understanding structured strategies or rules. The score leans towards ""Adequate"" as they understood the task at a fundamental level.

**Judgment:** The participant admits to not having a preconceived strategy, suggesting minimal proactive judgment or planning. The response is split between ""Rudimentary"" and ""Adequate"" because while there was some form of decision-making, it was reactive rather than planned.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection on the effectiveness of their approach is minimal, indicating they did some evaluation but it was not thorough or deeply reflective. The probabilities are distributed towards ""Rudimentary"" and ""Adequate.""

**Final Decision:** The participant eventually describes a consistent rule they applied, which was to follow the option that was rewarding them, indicating some level of strategic consistency by the end. This is scored higher towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"" as they did apply a clear decision rule, albeit a simple one.

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their approach, but the simplicity and directness of their statement imply a certain level of confidence in their method. The score is therefore higher towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary."""

Rationale: The participant's reflection, consisting only of ""No ; Not really,"" provides minimal to no information across all metacognitive dimensions. This response suggests a lack of engagement or understanding of the task, as well as an absence of any discernible strategy or evaluation of the task. The probabilities are heavily weighted towards a score of 0 (Absent) for each dimension because the participant does not provide any substantive information that would indicate comprehension, judgment, evaluation, decision-making, or confidence regarding their approach to the task. The slight probability assigned to a score of 1 (Rudimentary) acknowledges the minimal acknowledgment of the questions, albeit without any elaboration or insight."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant's brief mention of ""looking for patterns and streaks"" suggests some understanding of the task's nature, which involves identifying and adapting to patterns. However, the response lacks depth, indicating only a moderate grasp of the task's structure or goal.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of looking for patterns implies a basic plan or hypothesis about how to approach the task. The response is somewhat clear but lacks detailed explanation or depth, suggesting a judgment that is more than rudimentary but not thoroughly developed.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's reflection does not include any assessment of whether their strategy was effective or why it might have worked or failed. The response ""no"" following the strategy description suggests a lack of reflective evaluation.
- **Final Decision**: The participant does not clearly articulate a consistent rule or decision strategy they ultimately applied, other than a brief mention of looking for patterns. The response suggests some level of decision-making but lacks clarity and depth.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief and somewhat ambiguous response does not strongly convey confidence or doubt. The presence of a simple strategy without further elaboration or conviction suggests moderate uncertainty."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by mentioning the response to negative numbers and sticking with a choice that yields positive outcomes. The response is somewhat clear but lacks depth, suggesting a score leaning towards ""Adequate"" with some possibility of ""Good.""

**Judgment:** The participant outlines a specific plan of action (changing the player on negative outcomes and sticking with a positive one), indicating a clear judgment strategy. The response is more towards ""Good"" due to the clarity of the plan, though it lacks sophisticated insight for an ""Exemplary"" score.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection on strategy effectiveness is minimal and indirect. They imply some evaluation by stating they would stick with a number until it turns negative, but do not deeply reflect on why this strategy was chosen or its effectiveness, leading to a score leaning towards ""Adequate.""

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (switching choices based on outcomes), which is somewhat clear and indicates a thoughtful approach. The response leans towards ""Good"" but lacks the depth for a higher score.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their strategy is implied but not explicitly stated, leading to uncertainty in their reflection. The response suggests some level of confidence by the decision to stick with a strategy until it fails, but also shows doubt by the simplicity and brevity of the explanation. This results in a score leaning towards ""Adequate."""

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's brief statement suggests a basic understanding of the task's mechanics (sticking with a choice that previously succeeded). However, the lack of detailed explanation or acknowledgment of the task's complexity limits the score. The probability leans towards ""Adequate"" as they understood to stick with a rewarding option until it ceased to be rewarding.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of sticking with a successful option until failure implies some level of planning or hypothesis testing (""if this works, keep doing it""). The reflection lacks depth but shows some judgment in strategy application, hence a higher probability towards ""Good.""

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection on the strategy's effectiveness is minimal and vague (""until it didn't""). This suggests some level of evaluation but lacks depth or detailed reasoning about why the strategy might have stopped working, leading to a higher score in ""Adequate.""

**Final Decision:** The participant indicates a clear, albeit simple, decision rule (continue with a successful choice until it fails). This shows a consistent strategy application, meriting a higher score towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary.""

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their strategy is implied but not explicitly stated. The use of a simple rule suggests some confidence, but the lack of explicit self-assurance or doubt makes it difficult to score highly. The probabilities are distributed more towards ""Good"" due to the implied confidence in sticking with a working strategy until its failure."

- **Comprehension**: The participant's statement indicates a basic understanding of the task's goal (finding a consistently good partner), but lacks depth in explaining the task structure or rules. The response suggests some understanding but not a comprehensive grasp.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of finding a consistently good partner shows some planning and hypothesis formation. However, the brevity and lack of detail suggest that while there was some judgment involved, it was not deeply articulated.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy is minimal and implicit. The phrase ""no, not really"" might suggest some evaluation of strategy effectiveness, but it's unclear and not well-developed.
- **Final Decision**: The participant indicates a decision strategy (finding a consistently good partner) but does not elaborate on how consistently this strategy was applied or adjusted, which suggests a moderate level of clarity in their final decision-making process.
- **Confidence**: The participant's confidence in their strategy and understanding of the task is not clearly expressed. The uncertainty implied by ""no, not really"" suggests some doubt, but overall, confidence is neither strongly affirmed nor completely denied."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a good understanding of the task's goal, which was to maximize points by choosing the right person. The reflection indicates a grasp of the task structure and rules, though not in an exceptionally detailed manner, hence the higher probabilities towards the middle and upper range.

**Judgment:** The participant describes their initial strategy and the adjustments made, indicating some planning and hypothesis formation. The reflection shows a transition from a distrustful approach to one of trust based on task experience, suggesting a good level of judgment.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by recognizing the need to trust after several attempts. This shows a thoughtful evaluation of their approach and its outcomes, leaning towards a higher score.

**Final Decision:** The reflection indicates that the participant settled on a consistent decision strategy of trusting the person who gave the most points after initial experimentation. This shows a clear final decision strategy, meriting a higher score.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses some uncertainty initially (""I am a person who does not trust"") but also shows a growing confidence in their strategy by the end of the task. The scores reflect this progression from doubt to moderate confidence."

**Rationale:**
- **Comprehension:** The participant's response indicates a basic understanding of the task as they mention sticking with ""the left and middle people throughout the game."" This suggests some grasp of the task structure but lacks depth in explaining the rules or goals, hence a higher probability for scores 2 and 3.
- **Judgment:** The participant's strategy of choosing mainly two options (left and middle) shows some level of planning or hypothesis formation, but it's not clear how this decision was reached or if it was based on any specific observations or rules. Thus, a higher probability is given to score 2.
- **Evaluation:** The participant did not reflect on whether their strategy was effective or why it might have worked or not, leading to a high probability for score 0.
- **Final Decision:** The participant mentions a consistent approach (using the left and middle options), indicating some level of decision-making. However, the depth of this strategy is not fully articulated, leading to a higher probability for scores 3 and 2.

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's dynamics, as they recognize the need to switch partners based on performance. However, the reflection lacks depth in explaining the task's structure or goals beyond this aspect. The probabilities reflect an adequate to good understanding, with some room for more detailed comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant clearly describes a strategy based on the performance of partners, indicating a planned approach to the task. The mention of a ""fatigue"" factor also shows a hypothesis about the underlying mechanics of the task. This suggests a good level of judgment, with a tendency towards exemplary as they are applying conditional reasoning.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on their strategy's effectiveness by discussing the outcomes of switching partners and considering additional factors like ""fatigue."" This shows a good level of evaluation, with some exemplary insights into why their strategy might or might not be working.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (switching partners based on performance and occasionally due to suspected ""fatigue""). This indicates a clear final decision strategy, leaning towards exemplary as they not only followed a rule but also adapted it based on their observations.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses some doubt about their approach, particularly with the speculative nature of the ""fatigue"" factor and the terse ""Not really"" at the end, suggesting uncertainty about the overall strategy. This indicates moderate confidence, with significant doubt reflected in the scoring."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant shows some understanding of the task's goal, which is to stick with a winning option. However, the depth of understanding regarding the task structure or rules isn't fully articulated. The response suggests a basic grasp but lacks detail on how the task operates beyond choosing a ""winning person.""

**Judgment:**  
The participant formed a clear plan to ""stay with one person as long as possible,"" indicating a strategy based on sticking with a choice that appears to be winning. This shows a good level of judgment in forming a hypothesis about how to act within the task, though it's not highly sophisticated or nuanced.

**Evaluation:**  
The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their strategy by implying it was about sticking with a winner, but does not deeply analyze why this strategy worked or didn't work. There's some evaluation, but it's not thorough or detailed.

**Final Decision:**  
The participant describes a consistent decision strategy of staying with a winning option. This strategy is clear and somewhat detailed, suggesting a moderate to high level of final decision-making clarity.

**Confidence:**  
Confidence is somewhat expressed in the simplicity and consistency of the strategy used (""I tried to stay with a winning person"").

Rationale:  
- **Comprehension**: The participant's response suggests a minimal understanding of the task as they indicate making ""best guesses"" without elaborating on the task's structure or goals. This implies rudimentary comprehension but lacks depth or clarity.
- **Judgment**: The participant's mention of making ""best guesses"" indicates some form of decision-making process, albeit simplistic and not strategic. This suggests a basic level of judgment without sophisticated planning or hypothesis formation.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy or provide reasons for their choices, indicating a lack of evaluation.
- **Final Decision**: The participant's strategy seems consistent (""just made my best guesses""), but they do not articulate a clear rule or decision strategy, suggesting a basic but unclear approach.
- **Confidence**: The participant's use of a casual tone (""; Not really."") and lack of firm statements about their strategy or its effectiveness suggest low confidence in their approach or understanding of the task."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response indicates a basic understanding of the task's goal (choosing the option that ""consistently gave most""), suggesting some comprehension but not a deep or detailed understanding. The probabilities reflect a mix between adequate and good comprehension, with a slight possibility of rudimentary or exemplary understanding.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of choosing the option that gave the most rewards implies a decision-making process or plan, indicating some judgment. The probabilities lean towards a good judgment score, acknowledging that the participant had a clear plan, with some probability of an exemplary score due to the simplicity yet effectiveness of the strategy.

**Evaluation:** The participant did not reflect on whether their strategy worked or why, as indicated by the brief and non-reflective response to the second question (""no""). This suggests a high probability of an absent score in evaluation, with a slight chance of rudimentary reflection.

**Final Decision:** The participant described a consistent rule or decision strategy (""Just chose the one who consistently gave most""), which is clear and straightforward. The probabilities are higher for good and exemplary scores, recognizing the clarity of the final decision.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their approach is not explicitly stated, and the brief response suggests some uncertainty or lack of reflection on their confidence level. The probabilities are distributed to reflect this uncertainty, with a higher chance of an adequate score but some possibility of rudimentary or good confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response indicates some understanding of the task as they mention specific conditions under which they would switch strategies (""when a worker struggled for two tasks in a row or too many alternate tasks""). This suggests they grasped the task's dynamics to some extent, hence the higher probabilities for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a plan based on observed outcomes (""switched when a worker struggled""), showing some level of strategic thinking. The response is somewhat clear but lacks depth, leading to a higher probability for score 3, indicating a good level of judgment.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy is implied but not explicitly detailed (""Yes, I switched...""). They do not provide a clear rationale for why their strategy might have worked or failed, leading to a higher score in the middle range.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule for switching strategies, which shows a decision strategy. However, the explanation is not deeply sophisticated, warranting a higher score in the middle range, with some probability for a higher score due to the clarity of the rule described.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their strategy is not clearly expressed. The terse nature of the response and the inclusion of a semicolon followed by ""no"" suggest some uncertainty or minimal reflection on their confidence level, leading to a distribution across lower and middle scores."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's goal (to maximize points) and identifies negative point generators as undesirable. The response is somewhat clear but lacks depth in explaining the structure or rules of the task, hence a higher probability for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant indicates a strategy of choosing options that yield the most points and avoiding negative outcomes. This shows some planning and hypothesis formation, warranting a higher probability for scores 3, reflecting a good level of judgment.

**Evaluation:** The participant does not provide a detailed reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy beyond a simple acknowledgment of sticking to it, suggesting a moderate understanding of their strategy's success. This results in a higher probability for score 2.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states that they did not change their strategy throughout the task, indicating a consistent decision-making process. This consistency is well articulated, justifying higher probabilities for scores 4 and 3.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief response suggests some level of certainty in their strategy as they did not feel the need to change it. However, the lack of explicit confidence or doubt about their approach results in a higher probability for scores 3 and 2, reflecting clear but not exemplary confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows an understanding of the task's basic mechanics (sticking with one choice until it fails), but the reflection lacks depth about the overall structure or goal of the task. The probability leans towards ""Adequate"" as the participant grasps the task's immediate rules but does not elaborate on a deeper understanding.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy formulation is evident (""choose the same person until they started turning negative then choose another""), indicating some planning. The reflection suggests a clear, though simple, hypothesis about how to act, meriting a higher score in ""Good"" with some probability in ""Exemplary"" for clarity in strategy.

**Evaluation:** The participant briefly reflects on their strategy's effectiveness (""until they started turning negative""), but there's minimal depth or analysis about why this strategy was chosen or its effectiveness across different scenarios. This warrants a score leaning towards ""Adequate.""

**Final Decision:** The participant indicates a consistent decision strategy throughout the task and confirms sticking to it (""No, I stayed pretty consistent""). This shows a clear rule was applied, scoring higher in ""Good"" and ""Exemplary.""

**Confidence:** The participant's brief response shows some certainty in their approach, especially with the affirmation of consistency in strategy. However, the lack of detailed justification or exploration of alternatives suggests confidence but not at the highest level of metacognitive insight, thus a higher score in ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"" but not exclusively so."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a good understanding of the task rules and structure by sticking with a deck until a pattern emerges, indicating they grasped the goal of identifying and adapting to patterns. The response suggests a sophisticated understanding, hence the higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of waiting for a pattern before switching decks indicates a planned approach to the task. They formed a hypothesis about how to act, which is reflected in the higher scores for judgment.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on their strategy's effectiveness by noting their consistency and the decision to wait for a pattern. This shows some evaluation but lacks depth on why this strategy was effective or not, leading to a moderate score.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states a consistent rule or decision strategy, which was to stick with a deck until a pattern dictated otherwise. This strong and clear expression justifies a high score in this dimension.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses a degree of certainty about their approach by stating their behavior was consistent and by sticking to their strategy throughout the game. This shows a high level of confidence, meriting higher scores in this dimension."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's mechanics (staying on a positive option and switching upon a negative outcome). However, the explanation lacks depth in fully grasping the strategic implications or the broader rules of the task, hence a higher probability for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant describes a strategy of staying with a positive outcome and switching when it turns negative, indicating some level of planning or hypothesis formation. The response suggests a moderate level of strategic thinking, justifying higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy (""knowing it would run out""), showing some evaluation of their approach's sustainability. This warrants a higher probability for scores 3 and 4, indicating a good level of reflection on strategy effectiveness.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (""stayed on one while it was positive and once it changed then I went to the next""), which is fairly clear and suggests a thoughtful approach. This supports higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Confidence:** The participant shows some uncertainty in their strategy (""just trying to find that sweet spot but knowing it would run out""), indicating a mix of confidence and doubt. This mixed expression justifies a balanced distribution across the middle scores (2, 3, and 1)."

**Rationale:**
- **Comprehension:** The participant's response is extremely brief and lacks detail, but the mention of ""number and color strategy"" suggests a rudimentary understanding of the task's elements (possibly referring to the choices available in the task). Therefore, a higher probability is given to a score of 1, indicating a minimal expression of understanding.
- **Judgment:** The response is too brief to clearly indicate any hypothesis or plan formation. The phrase ""number and color strategy"" is too vague to be considered a clear plan, thus a high probability is assigned to a score of 1, indicating a rudimentary level of judgment.
- **Evaluation:** There is no reflection on whether the strategy worked or why, which leads to a high probability of scoring 0, indicating an absence of evaluation.
- **Final Decision:** The participant indicates a change in strategy with a simple ""yes"" but does not describe what the final strategy was or how it was applied consistently. This results in a high probability of scoring 1, indicating a rudimentary level of final decision-making.

The reflection indicates a clear grasp of the goal to maximize scores by identifying the '100' category and managing risk when outcomes flipped to '-50'. The probability leans towards a higher score due to the clear articulation of task mechanics.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a clear hypothesis about how to act, initially sticking with a choice unless it repeatedly showed negative outcomes. They also experimented with a different strategy mid-task, which shows planning and hypothesis testing. The reflection suggests a thoughtful approach to strategy formulation, deserving a higher score.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflected on the effectiveness of their strategies by noting the outcome of switching strategies and reverting when the new approach was less successful. This indicates a good level of self-assessment and understanding of strategy effectiveness, justifying a higher score.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy they ultimately applied, which was to revert to their original strategy after testing an alternative. This shows a clear decision-making process based on the evaluation of outcomes, meriting a higher score.

- **Comprehension**: The participant clearly understood the task rules and goals, as evidenced by their strategy of sticking with one emoji until it ceased to be beneficial. The reflection shows a good understanding of the task's probabilistic nature and the need for strategy adjustment, hence the high scores in the upper range.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a clear hypothesis about which emoji might yield the most points and planned their actions accordingly. They initially favored the red emoji but adjusted their hypothesis based on the task's feedback, showing a sophisticated approach to judgment.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflected on the effectiveness of their strategy by recognizing when an emoji stopped being beneficial and considered the performance of other emojis. This indicates a thoughtful evaluation process, deserving a higher score.
- **Final Decision**: The participant described a consistent rule or decision strategy by initially sticking to one emoji and then switching when necessary. They also ranked the emojis based on perceived benefit, showing a clear decision-making process.
- **Confidence**: The participant expressed a degree of certainty in their approach, especially in their initial preference for the red emoji and later adjustments. The reflection shows confidence in their understanding and strategy adjustments, meriting a higher score in this dimension."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows an understanding of the task's pattern (noticing pairs) but does not explicitly mention understanding the rules or goals of the task. The response suggests a moderate understanding, hence a higher probability for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a hypothesis based on their observation (selecting the same ""person"" again if it was correct previously). This indicates a clear plan of action, leaning towards a good judgment score, thus higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their strategy (""it seemed like they came in pairs""), but there is no deep analysis of why this strategy worked or didn't, which suggests an adequate to good evaluation, hence a higher probability for score 2.

**Final Decision:** The participant indicates a consistent decision strategy by sticking with the pairs throughout the task. This shows a clear final decision strategy, warranting higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Confidence:** The participant's statement shows some level of certainty in their strategy as they did not switch strategies and used the same approach consistently. This suggests a higher confidence level, thus higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's goal (finding the profitable option) and the structure (switching when it stops rewarding). The response is not very detailed but indicates adequate comprehension. Hence, a higher probability is given to scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant describes a clear initial strategy of random selection followed by sticking with a rewarding option. This shows some planning and hypothesis formation, warranting a higher score in judgment, predominantly leaning towards a score of 3.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the shift when the chosen option ceased to be profitable. This indicates some evaluation of strategy success, justifying a higher score in this dimension, with a lean towards score 3.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent decision strategy of sticking with a rewarding option until it stops giving points. This shows a clear rule-based approach, supporting a higher score, with a significant probability assigned to scores 4 and 3.

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt, but the straightforward statement of their strategy suggests a level of certainty about their approach. This supports assigning higher probabilities to scores 4 and 3, indicating some implicit confidence in their understanding and strategy."

Rationale: The participant's reflection, consisting solely of the phrase ""No, I did not,"" provides almost no information relevant to any of the five dimensions of the Metacognitive Prompting framework. This response does not indicate whether the participant understood the task rules, structure, or goal (Comprehension), nor does it suggest any hypothesis or plan about how to act (Judgment). There is no reflection on whether their strategy worked or why (Evaluation), no description of a consistent rule or decision strategy (Final Decision), and no expression of certainty or doubt about their approach or understanding (Confidence). Therefore, the probabilities are heavily weighted towards a score of 0 (Absent) for each dimension, with a slight possibility (0.1) of a score of 1 (Rudimentary) to allow for any minimal, implicit understanding or strategy that might not have been expressed directly in the response."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's brief response indicates a basic understanding of the task's dynamic nature (switching based on performance feedback). However, the depth of understanding isn't fully clear, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of switching based on performance suggests some level of planning or hypothesis formation about how to act, which is why the probabilities lean towards ""Good.""

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection implies an evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness (""Switch when they start giving bad scores""), indicating some reflection on whether their strategy worked. This leans towards a ""Good"" score.

**Final Decision:** The participant's response to not switching strategies (""No"") after initially deciding to switch based on performance suggests a strong adherence to their chosen strategy, justifying a high score in ""Final Decision.""

**Confidence:** The participant's concise and straightforward response without expressing doubt suggests a high level of confidence in their understanding and strategy, leading to a high probability for an ""Exemplary"" score in this dimension."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a good understanding of the task's structure and goals by recognizing the pattern and the rewarding colors. The response indicates a clear grasp of the task dynamics, hence the higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a hypothesis about sticking with a color that initially proved correct and observed the rewarding colors. This indicates a strategic approach to the task, justifying higher scores in judgment.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the success of sticking with a color after it proves correct. This shows some evaluation but lacks depth about why this strategy might work or fail, hence a balanced spread across the middle scores.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states that once a strategy was found, they stuck to it. This demonstrates a strong and consistent decision strategy, justifying a high score in this dimension.

**Confidence:** The participant's language (""i saw,"" ""i noticed"") and the statement about sticking to the strategy once found suggest a high level of confidence in their approach, meriting higher scores in this dimension."

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on their strategy's effectiveness and briefly considers an alternative in the last game, showing some evaluation. The probabilities suggest a good level of reflection but not a deep or comprehensive analysis of strategy effectiveness.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule they applied throughout the task, with a brief deviation towards the end. The probabilities favor a good to exemplary score, reflecting a clear and mostly consistent decision-making process.

- **Judgment**: The participant formed a clear hypothesis about how to act, which involved switching partners based on the outcome of previous interactions. This strategy indicates a thoughtful plan, although there was some admitted inconsistency, which prevents the highest score.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflected on the effectiveness of their strategy and considered the possibility of changing it based on the performance of the partners. They acknowledged not tracking the scores carefully but thought about what might have been if they had. This shows a good level of self-evaluation.
- **Final Decision**: The participant described a consistent rule for their decision-making process, which involved switching partners based on negative scores and trying to use the least recently used partner. They also considered, but ultimately did not make, changes to this strategy based on insufficient data, which shows a rational approach to decision-making.
- **Confidence**: The participant expressed some doubt about their approach, particularly regarding the reliability of past performance as an indicator of future results and their own tracking of the scores.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response suggests a basic understanding of the task as they acknowledge the use of strategy, albeit inconsistently. The probability distribution leans towards a lower score because the understanding isn't clearly articulated or detailed, but there is some evidence they grasped the task's demands.

**Judgment:** The participant indicates some level of planning or hypothesizing (""Sometimes I did"") but also states a lack of consistent strategy use. This suggests a rudimentary to adequate level of judgment used intermittently. The higher probabilities are given to lower scores reflecting the vague and minimal planning described.

**Evaluation:** The reflection lacks a clear assessment of whether the strategies used were effective or why certain decisions were made. The participant does not provide insight into the success or failure of their actions, leading to a higher probability of lower scores.

**Final Decision:** The participant mentions not using a particular strategy consistently, which implies a lack of a consistent rule or decision strategy. The response suggests some level of decision-making but not a well-defined or consistent approach, justifying mid to lower range scores.

**Confidence:** The participant's statement reflects some uncertainty and inconsistency in their approach (""No, didn't use a particular strategy. ; Sometimes I did but for the most part, no.""). This indicates a lack of confidence in their strategy usage, warranting a distribution that leans towards lower confidence scores."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's statement ""no ; I didn't use any strategy in the game"" suggests a minimal understanding of the task's strategic requirements, indicating some awareness but a lack of engagement with the task's deeper strategic elements. The probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards rudimentary understanding, with some chance of adequate comprehension if the participant understood the game but chose not to engage strategically.

**Judgment:** The explicit statement of not using any strategy indicates a near absence of forming a hypothesis or plan about how to act within the game. The high probability for a score of 0 reflects this lack of strategic planning.

**Evaluation:** Similarly, the lack of strategy use implies that there was no reflection on the effectiveness of a strategy or reasons for its success or failure. The probabilities are skewed towards a score of 0, reflecting an absence of this dimension.

**Final Decision:** The participant's statement indirectly suggests that their final decision was to not engage with strategic play. This is interpreted as a consistent rule or decision strategy (i.e., non-engagement), but it's a minimalistic approach. The probabilities reflect some chance of rudimentary to adequate scoring, considering that a decision to not strategize is still a form of decision-making.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and definitive statement shows a high level of confidence in their approach (or non-approach) to the game. The probabilities are weighted towards higher scores in this dimension, reflecting the participant's certainty about their chosen method (or lack thereof)."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response is minimal and does not explicitly show a deep understanding of the task rules, structure, or goal. However, the mention of making a decision implies some level of understanding. The probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards rudimentary to adequate comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant indicates they made a decision based on their thoughts, suggesting some form of judgment or planning was involved. The response is not detailed, so higher scores are less likely. The distribution leans towards rudimentary to adequate judgment.

**Evaluation:** The participant's response lacks any reflection on the effectiveness or reasoning behind their strategy, leading to a high probability for an absent score in evaluation.

**Final Decision:** The participant mentions making a decision, but there is no clear description of a consistent rule or strategy applied throughout the task. The probabilities suggest a rudimentary to adequate understanding of their final decision-making process.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief response does not convey a strong sense of certainty or doubt about their approach or understanding. The probabilities are distributed to reflect uncertainty, leaning towards rudimentary to adequate confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant understood the basic task structure, as indicated by their strategy of sticking with one choice until it failed. This shows a grasp of the task's reversal nature, but the explanation lacks depth about the overall goal or rules beyond the immediate response to negative feedback. Hence, a split between ""Adequate"" and ""Good"" seems fair.

**Judgment:** The participant clearly formed a plan to stick with one choice until it failed, which shows a straightforward but effective approach to the task. The clarity and simplicity of the plan suggest a strong judgment, leaning more towards ""Good.""

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection lacks a detailed analysis of why their strategy worked, but the simplicity and effectiveness of the strategy in a probabilistic task suggest a high level of implicit evaluation. They understood the effectiveness of their approach, which is why a higher score in ""Evaluation"" is justified.

**Final Decision:** The participant explicitly stated their decision strategy and did not indicate any deviation from it throughout the task. This clear and consistent adherence to a single strategy justifies a perfect score in ""Final Decision.""

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and straightforward response, with no indication of doubt or reconsideration, reflects a high level of confidence in their chosen strategy. The lack of any expressed uncertainty supports a high score in this dimension."

Rationale:  
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows some understanding of the task by recognizing the need to stick with a strategy until it fails. However, the depth of understanding the task structure or rules isn't fully articulated, hence a higher probability in the middle range.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a basic plan to stick with what works, indicating some level of judgment. The clarity isn't profound, but there is a definite plan mentioned, thus a higher score in the 'Good' range.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the challenge in finding a working strategy, which shows some evaluation. The reflection isn't deeply analytical but acknowledges strategy effectiveness, leading to a higher score in 'Good'.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule of sticking with what works until it doesn't. This shows a clear decision strategy, though not highly sophisticated, hence a higher score in 'Good'.
- **Confidence**: The participant shows some uncertainty in their approach, especially in finding a working strategy, which indicates moderate confidence. The expression of doubt prevents higher scores in confidence, leading to a peak in 'Adequate'."

**Rationale:**  
The participant's reflection, ""no strategy; no,"" is extremely brief and lacks depth across all metacognitive dimensions. 

- **Comprehension:** The response suggests a minimal understanding of the task, as acknowledging the absence of a strategy might imply some basic awareness of the task's demands. However, there is no evidence of a deeper understanding or engagement with the task rules or goals.
- **Judgment:** The participant indicates no formation of a hypothesis or plan (""no strategy""), which suggests a lack of proactive or strategic thinking about how to approach the task.
- **Evaluation:** There is no reflection on the effectiveness of their approach or any reasoning about why they chose not to use a strategy, indicating a lack of evaluative thinking.
- **Final Decision:** The participant does not describe any consistent rule or decision strategy, only the absence of one. This suggests a lack of strategic decision-making.
- **Confidence:** The terse response does not explicitly convey confidence or doubt; however, the lack of engagement might imply a low level of confidence or interest in the task.

Given the brevity and lack of substantive content in the reflection, the probabilities are heavily weighted towards a score of 0, indicating an absence of metacognitive engagement across all dimensions."

- **Comprehension**: The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by describing their approach to switching partners based on payoff outcomes. The response indicates a grasp of the task's structure and goal, hence the higher probabilities towards the upper end of the scale.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy formulation is evident as they describe sticking with a partner until a non-payoff round and then switching. This shows a planned approach, meriting a higher score in judgment.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly suggesting it was based on the payoff outcome, but does not deeply analyze why this strategy worked or didn't, hence a moderate score.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy by sticking with the partner that pays off, which shows a clear decision-making process. This is reflected in the higher probabilities towards the upper scale.
- **Confidence**: The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their strategy. However, the straightforward statement of their approach suggests some level of confidence, thus the probabilities lean towards the higher end but not fully exemplary."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant shows an understanding of the task's feedback mechanism (receiving -50) and reacts accordingly. The response indicates a basic grasp of the task structure, but lacks depth in explaining the overall goal or rules beyond reacting to negative feedback. Hence, a higher probability is given to an ""Adequate"" score.

**Judgment:**  
The participant's strategy of changing partners after negative feedback suggests some form of planning or hypothesis testing (""if I get -50, then I change partners""). This indicates a clear judgment process, though not highly detailed or sophisticated. A ""Good"" score is most probable, with some possibility of an ""Exemplary"" score due to the clear conditional reasoning.

**Evaluation:**  
The reflection minimally evaluates the effectiveness of the strategy, primarily implied through the continued use of the strategy (changing partners upon receiving -50). The participant does not explicitly reflect on why this strategy might work or not, leading to a higher score in ""Adequate.""

**Final Decision:**  
The participant describes a consistent rule they applied throughout the task (changing partners after negative feedback). This shows a clear decision strategy, leaning towards a ""Good"" or ""Exemplary"" score, as they stuck to this rule throughout the task.

**Confidence:**  
The participant's confidence in their strategy is not explicitly stated, and the brief response suggests some uncertainty or minimal reflection on the confidence aspect. The probabilities are spread across lower scores, indicating uncertainty about the participant's confidence level."

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by sticking with one option until it no longer yields positive results. The response indicates a grasp of the task's probabilistic nature, though not deeply explained. The probabilities reflect a good but not exemplary understanding.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of sticking with one choice until it fails suggests a planned approach, though not elaborately justified or explored. The higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4 reflect this implicit planning.

**Evaluation:** The participant briefly reflects on the outcome of their strategy (""until the numbers were negative""), indicating some level of evaluation but lacking depth or a thorough analysis of why the strategy worked or didn't. The distribution leans towards an adequate reflection.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states a consistent decision strategy (""kept choosing the same person""), which they adhered to throughout the task. The high probabilities for scores 3 and 4 reflect this clear articulation of a consistent rule.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant shows a clear understanding of the task's goal, which was to identify the option providing the most consistent positive outcomes. The reflection indicates a grasp of the task structure and rules, hence the higher probabilities towards the upper end of the scale.

**Judgment:**  
The participant formed a plan to track and choose the option with the most consistent positive results. This indicates a strategic approach, meriting a higher score in judgment. The reflection suggests a structured approach but lacks detailed explanation of how choices were tracked or compared, hence not a full score.

**Evaluation:**  
The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by mentioning the switch in choices upon receiving too many negative results. This shows a good level of self-evaluation and adjustment based on outcomes, justifying higher scores in this dimension.

**Final Decision:**  
The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy by initially selecting based on consistency and then switching upon negative outcomes. This indicates a clear strategy, though the reflection could have benefited from more detail on the criteria for switching, hence the distribution leaning towards higher scores but not fully exemplary.

**Confidence:**  
The participant's confidence in their approach is implied rather than explicitly stated. They mention a clear strategy and a reason for switching, which suggests some level of confidence. However, the lack of explicit confidence or doubt expressions leads to a more balanced distribution across the middle scores."

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task by sticking with a choice that previously resulted in a reward. The reflection indicates an understanding of the task's reward structure, though not deeply explained. The probabilities reflect a good understanding but not exemplary due to lack of depth.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of sticking with a rewarding choice until it changes suggests a planned approach, indicating some judgment in decision-making. The higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4 reflect this clear but not sophisticated strategy.

**Evaluation:** The participant's brief reflection on strategy effectiveness (""until the partner changed"") suggests some evaluation but lacks depth or detailed analysis of why the strategy worked or didn't. The distribution leans towards an adequate understanding.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule they applied (""stuck with the partner that resulted in 100""), which shows a clear final decision strategy. The probabilities are higher for scores 3 and 4, indicating a good to exemplary clarity in describing their decision-making process.

**Confidence:** The participant's use of a semicolon followed by a brief negation (""Not really"") suggests some uncertainty or reconsideration about their strategy, indicating a level of confidence but with some doubt.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's reflection shows some understanding of the task as they mention trying to anticipate a change, which is relevant to a reversal learning task. However, the reflection lacks depth about the specific rules or structure of the task, hence the higher probabilities for scores 1 and 2.

**Judgment:** The participant indicates a strategy of anticipation, which reflects some form of hypothesis or plan. The clarity and depth are not fully developed, but there is evidence of a basic judgment process, leading to higher probabilities for scores 2 and 3.

**Evaluation:** The participant does not provide much reflection on whether their strategy was effective or why it might have worked or failed. The response is mostly absent of evaluation, thus the high probability for a score of 0.

**Final Decision:** The participant's strategy seems to be consistent, as indicated by their brief response to not switching strategies. This suggests a somewhat clear decision strategy, warranting higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their approach or understanding is not explicitly mentioned, and the brief nature of the response suggests some uncertainty. This leads to a higher probability for a score of 2, with some chance of lower confidence reflected in scores 1 and 0."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by sticking to a deck after a successful outcome (score of 100). However, the response lacks depth in explaining the overall goal or structure of the task, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" rating.
- **Judgment**: The participant indicates a clear plan (sticking with a deck after a high score), suggesting some level of strategic thinking. The response hints at a hypothesis about the task's mechanics, thus leaning towards a ""Good"" rating.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy beyond a simple action-reaction statement. There is no analysis of why this strategy might work or fail, leading to a high probability of an ""Absent"" rating.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule they applied (continuing with a deck after scoring 100), which is a clear decision strategy. This warrants a higher score towards ""Exemplary"".
- **Confidence**: The participant's confidence in their strategy is not explicitly stated, and the brevity and simplicity of the response suggest uncertainty or minimal self-assurance. This results in a higher probability for ""Adequate"" and ""Rudimentary"" ratings."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's goal (to stick with the person who had 100 points). The reflection indicates some grasp of the task structure but lacks depth in explaining the rules fully. The probabilities reflect a good but not exemplary understanding.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan (to follow the person with 100 points) and adapted when needed. The reflection shows a clear strategy but lacks depth in strategic planning or anticipation of changes, hence a higher probability towards a good score.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their strategy (""I would have to change my selection when that person did not have the 100 points""), indicating some evaluation but not a deep analysis of why changes were necessary or how effective the strategy was overall.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (sticking with the person who had 100 points and changing when necessary). The reflection shows a clear decision-making process, leaning towards a good to exemplary description.

**Confidence:** The participant's reflection shows some confidence in their strategy by sticking to a rule-based approach, but there is minimal expression of certainty about its effectiveness, hence a higher probability towards a good score. The participant does not express significant doubt, which supports a lower probability for lower scores."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a clear understanding of the task's structure and rules by describing their response to specific outcomes (-50 points). They demonstrate an understanding of the task's probabilistic nature and the need for strategy adjustment based on outcomes. The probabilities reflect a good understanding, though not fully comprehensive, hence a higher score towards 3.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a hypothesis about when to switch decks based on the frequency of negative outcomes. This indicates a planned approach to the task, showing clear judgment. The probabilities lean towards a good score, acknowledging the presence of a clear strategy but not a highly sophisticated one.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on their strategy's effectiveness by adjusting it later in the game, indicating some evaluation of their approach. However, the depth of this reflection is not fully detailed or comprehensive, leading to a higher probability around scores 2 and 3.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule they applied (waiting for -50 points occurrences) and mentions adjusting this rule as the game progressed. This shows a clear decision strategy, though the explanation of why this adjustment was made could be more detailed, leading to a higher score towards 3.

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their strategy, but the adjustment of the strategy suggests some uncertainty or reevaluation. The probabilities reflect moderate confidence, with a slight lean towards uncertainty, hence a higher score around 2 and 3."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant clearly understood the task rules and goals as they described sticking with a performing option and switching when it ceased to perform. The strategy indicates a good grasp of the task's probabilistic nature and reversal learning aspect. The high scores reflect this understanding.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a clear plan to stay with a performing stack and then cycle through others when needed. This shows a strategic approach to the task, deserving a higher score, indicating a thoughtful and planned method.

**Evaluation:** The participant implicitly evaluated their strategy by mentioning they switched when the stack stopped performing well. This shows some reflection on the strategy's effectiveness, though not deeply detailed, hence a balanced score distribution leaning slightly towards higher values.

**Final Decision:** The participant described a consistent rule or decision strategy by sticking to a stack until performance declined and then cycling through others. This shows a clear and consistent strategy application, meriting a higher score.

**Confidence:** The participant did not express explicit confidence or doubt but demonstrated a clear and consistent strategy without questioning its validity, suggesting a higher level of confidence in their approach. The higher scores reflect this implicit confidence."

However, the lack of explicit acknowledgment of the rules or goals limits the score to mostly adequate.
- **Judgment**: The participant's statement implies a rudimentary form of decision-making (""Just keep going with the one that's giving me points""), but lacks a clear, premeditated plan or hypothesis about how to approach the task, leading to a higher probability for a rudimentary score.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not reflect on the effectiveness of their approach beyond a simple continuation of what seemed to work, showing a significant lack of evaluative thought.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's reflection indicates some understanding of the task as they identified a ""good"" deck and noted a specific outcome (6 100 cards in a row). This suggests they grasped the task's structure to some extent, hence the higher probabilities for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy seems to involve choosing the ""right hand deck"" based on observed outcomes, which shows some planning. However, the reflection lacks depth on how this decision was made, leading to a higher probability for a score of 2.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection briefly mentions the outcome of their strategy (""6 100 cards in a row""), but there is minimal reflection on why this strategy worked or didn't, which is why scores 1 and 2 are more probable.

**Final Decision:** The participant mentions sticking with the ""right hand deck,"" indicating some consistency in their strategy. However, the lack of detailed reasoning or adaptation leads to a higher score in the middle range.

Rationale: The participant's reflection is extremely brief and lacks depth across all dimensions. 

- **Comprehension**: The mention of ""points given by partner"" suggests a minimal understanding that points are involved, but there's no clear indication that the participant comprehends the task's rules, structure, or goals. A score of 1 is given a slight probability due to the acknowledgment of points, which are a fundamental part of the task.
  
- **Judgment**: The response does not articulate any hypothesis or plan about how to act within the task. The participant merely acknowledges the receipt of points, which does not constitute a strategy or plan.

- **Evaluation**: There is no reflection on whether the strategy worked or why, as the participant does not describe any strategy beyond reacting to points given by a partner.

- **Final Decision**: The participant does not describe any consistent rule or decision strategy they ultimately applied. The response is too vague to infer any strategic decision-making.

- **Confidence**: The participant does not express any certainty or doubt about their approach or understanding of the task. The response lacks any indication of confidence.

Overall, the reflection provided by the participant does not demonstrate meaningful insight or understanding of the task, resulting in low scores across all dimensions."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant's statement ""just tried to see if there were any patterns"" suggests a basic understanding of the task's nature, which involves pattern recognition. However, the lack of detailed explanation about the task structure or rules leads to a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a hypothesis (""tried to see if there were any patterns"") and acted on disproving their theories, indicating some level of planning and hypothesis testing. This leans towards a ""Good"" score due to the clear mention of forming and testing a hypothesis.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's mention of disproving their own theories indicates they reflected on the effectiveness of their strategy. This reflection on strategy effectiveness suggests a ""Good"" score, with some probability for an ""Exemplary"" score due to the self-awareness in strategy adjustment.
- **Final Decision**: The participant indicates a strategy shift but does not clearly describe a consistent final strategy, leading to a split between ""Adequate"" and ""Good"". There is some indication of decision-making but not enough detail for a higher score.
- **Confidence**: The participant's language shows some uncertainty and minimal confidence in their approach (""not particularly,"" ""just tried""), suggesting they were not very confident in their strategy. This results in a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score."

- **Judgment**: The participant formed a basic plan (switching decks after two negative results), which shows some strategic thinking. The clarity and simplicity of the plan suggest a good level of judgment, leading to higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.
- **Evaluation**: The participant implicitly reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by deciding to switch decks after repeated negative outcomes, indicating some evaluation of their approach. This warrants moderate to high scores.
- **Final Decision**: The participant clearly states a consistent rule for their decision-making process (switching decks after two negatives), which is a straightforward and practical strategy, justifying higher scores in this dimension.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief response does not explicitly state confidence, but the decisiveness in their strategy (""If... then..."") and the lack of expressed doubt suggest a high level of confidence in their understanding and approach, leading to a high probability for score 4."

This indicates a good grasp of the task rules and goals. The probabilities reflect a strong comprehension, though not at the highest level due to the brevity and lack of explicit mention of all task rules.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy involved monitoring outcomes and adjusting behavior based on these observations, which shows a planned approach to the task. The decision to switch strategies based on the performance of the cards indicates a hypothesis-driven approach, deserving a higher score.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the change in card productivity and adjusting their actions accordingly. This shows a good level of self-evaluation, though the depth of this reflection could be greater, hence the distribution leaning towards higher scores but not the highest.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes sticking with their strategy of switching cards when they stop producing, with only minor adjustments. This indicates a consistent decision-making process, which is articulated clearly. The higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4 reflect this clarity and consistency.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses a degree of certainty in their approach by clearly stating their observations and subsequent actions. However, there is some ambiguity in their confidence, as indicated by the use of a casual tone (""Nope, stuck with that."") and minimal elaboration on the certainty of their decisions. This results in a moderate to high score, but not the highest."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's reflection indicates a basic understanding of the task's mechanics (switching choices based on diminishing returns), but lacks depth in explaining the overall goal or rules. The probability leans towards ""Adequate"" as they understood to switch when rewards decreased, but it's not clear if they grasped the full structure of the task.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan (to switch choices when rewards diminish), which shows some strategic thinking. The probabilities are distributed towards ""Good"" as they had a clear, albeit simple, hypothesis about how to act.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflected on their strategy's effectiveness by noting the decrease in rewards, which prompted a switch. This shows a decent level of self-assessment, leaning towards ""Good"" as they evaluated the outcomes of their actions.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly stated that they consistently applied the rule of switching choices when rewards decreased. This shows a strong adherence to a decision strategy, justifying a high probability for ""Exemplary.""

**Confidence:** The participant did not express any doubt about their approach, suggesting a high level of confidence in their strategy. The probabilities are skewed towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"" as they seemed sure of their method, despite the simplicity of the strategy."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows some understanding of the task as they mention switching partners after receiving two negatives, indicating they grasped the feedback mechanism. However, the reflection lacks depth about the overall goal or structure, hence a higher probability in the middle range.

**Judgment:** The participant's statement about switching after two negatives suggests a basic plan or hypothesis was formed, albeit a simple one. The lack of a more sophisticated strategy or deeper planning leads to a higher score in the lower-middle range.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their approach by implicitly suggesting it was their method to handle negatives. However, there's no deep analysis or reasoning about why this strategy was chosen or its effectiveness, leading to a moderate score.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule (switching after two negatives), but it's a simple rule with limited strategic depth. The reflection does not elaborate on any adjustments or refinements to this rule, which suggests a moderate understanding and application.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses some doubt about their approach by stating, ""I don't think I really used a strategy."" This shows self-awareness but also uncertainty, leading to a moderate score in this dimension. The lack of strong confidence or conviction in their method is evident."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by mentioning a specific condition (-50 score for two rounds) that triggers a strategy change. However, the explanation is not detailed, suggesting a moderate level of comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant clearly had a plan (waiting for the score to hit -50 twice before switching), indicating some judgment. The clarity and specificity of the plan suggest a good level of judgment, but not exemplary as there is no indication of why this specific criterion was chosen.

**Evaluation:** The participant mentions a strategy but does not deeply reflect on its effectiveness or reasons for choosing it, suggesting only a moderate level of evaluation.

**Final Decision:** The participant states they kept the same strategy throughout the game, which shows a consistent decision strategy. The clarity in this part of the response is higher, suggesting a good to exemplary understanding of their final decision-making process.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and straightforward response indicates a level of confidence in their strategy and understanding of the game. The lack of doubt or uncertainty in their reflection suggests a higher score in confidence."

Rationale:  
- **Comprehension**: The participant's statement ""It seemed random to me but what do I know"" suggests a low level of understanding of the task's structure or rules. The probability is high (0.7) for a score of 0, indicating an absence of comprehension, with a slight chance (0.2) for rudimentary understanding.
- **Judgment**: The participant does not explicitly mention forming any hypothesis or plan, reflected in the high probability (0.8) for a score of 0. There's a minimal chance (0.1) that they had some vague plan, given the uncertain tone of their response.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's reflection lacks any indication of evaluating the effectiveness of a strategy, leading to a high probability (0.9) of scoring 0. The slight probability (0.1) for a score of 1 acknowledges the minimal possibility of implicit evaluation.
- **Final Decision**: The participant's response ""No"" to whether they switched strategies suggests they might not have had a clear strategy to begin with. This results in a high probability (0.8) for a score of 0, with a small chance (0.2) for rudimentary description of a decision strategy.
- **Confidence**: The participant's use of a semi-joking tone (""but what do I know"") and the inclusion of a winking emoticon suggest some level of uncertainty or doubt about their approach. This leads to a moderate probability (0.4) for a score of 2 (adequate confidence), with some probability (0.3) for rudimentary and (0.1) for absent confidence."

- **Comprehension**: The participant clearly understood the task rules and structure, as evidenced by their ability to describe the color-based decision-making process. They demonstrated a good grasp of the task's goal, which was to stick with a choice until it proved unsuccessful. The high scores reflect this understanding.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a clear plan to continue selecting the same option (green) until it resulted in a negative outcome. This shows a well-defined hypothesis about how to approach the task, justifying a higher score.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's reflection lacks depth in evaluating the effectiveness of their strategy beyond a basic description of sticking to one color. There is no discussion about why this strategy might have been effective or not, leading to a lower score.
- **Final Decision**: The participant consistently applied a single strategy throughout the task, as explicitly stated in their reflection. This shows a high level of consistency in their decision-making process.
- **Confidence**: The participant expressed a high level of certainty in their approach by stating they stuck with the same strategy throughout the game without indicating any doubt or reconsideration. This suggests a strong confidence in their chosen method."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task by identifying the goal of selecting players based on consistency and potential for high points. The response indicates a grasp of the task's structure but lacks depth in explaining the rules or the strategic implications fully, hence the spread leaning towards higher scores but not the highest.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan by choosing to stick with the two most consistent players. This shows some level of strategic planning and hypothesis formation, but the reflection lacks detail on how these choices were determined beyond the vague criteria of consistency and point-making potential. The distribution leans towards a good understanding but not exemplary due to the lack of depth.

**Evaluation:** The participant does not explicitly reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy beyond stating that they did not change it, suggesting a presumption that it was effective without detailed evaluation. There is minimal reflection on why this strategy was effective or not, leading to a spread across lower scores.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states that they did not change their strategy, indicating a strong adherence to their initial decision. This shows a high level of consistency in their decision-making process, justifying a high score in this dimension.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief statement about sticking with their strategy without change suggests a high level of confidence in their decision. The lack of doubt or reconsideration in their reflection supports a high score in confidence, indicating they were very sure of their approach."

Rationale: The participant's response, ""Not at all,"" provides minimal information and does not explicitly address any of the metacognitive dimensions outlined in the MP framework. This response suggests a lack of engagement or understanding of the task, strategies, or reflection process. Therefore, the probabilities are heavily weighted towards a score of 0 (Absent) across all dimensions, with a slight possibility (0.1) of a rudimentary level (1) if interpreted as a minimal acknowledgment of the questions asked."

Confidence: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9]  

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's statement ""I didn't really have a strategy"" suggests a rudimentary understanding of the task, as they acknowledge the lack of a strategic approach. This indicates some level of awareness about the task's demands (i.e., that a strategy might be beneficial), but does not demonstrate a clear understanding of how to engage with the task effectively.

**Judgment:** The participant explicitly states they did not have a strategy, indicating an absence of forming any hypothesis or plan about how to act within the task. This suggests a high probability that this dimension is absent.

**Evaluation:** Similar to judgment, the lack of a strategy implies there was no reflection on the effectiveness of a strategy or reasons for its success or failure. This dimension appears to be absent as the participant does not provide any insight into evaluating their approach.

**Final Decision:** The participant's admission of not having a strategy suggests they did not arrive at any consistent rule or decision strategy during the task. This dimension is scored predominantly as absent, with a slight chance for rudimentary, given they at least recognized the absence of a strategy.

**Confidence:** Despite the overall lack of strategic engagement, the participant's statement is expressed with a high degree of certainty and clarity about their approach, or lack thereof. This suggests a high level of confidence in their self-assessment, warranting a high score in this dimension."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows some understanding of the task rules by indicating a response to specific outcomes (-50 points). The strategy of switching after a repeated negative outcome suggests an adequate grasp of the task's probabilistic nature. The probabilities reflect a good but not exemplary understanding.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of sticking with a choice unless it repeatedly fails indicates a planned approach to the task. The reflection shows a clear judgment strategy, leaning towards a higher score as they seem to have a hypothesis about when to switch choices.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection on their strategy is somewhat implicit. They mention a specific action in response to outcomes, which shows some level of strategy evaluation but lacks depth in analyzing why this strategy might be effective or not.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule for their decision-making process (sticking with a choice unless it fails twice). This shows a clear final decision strategy, meriting a higher score as it reflects a thoughtful and somewhat sophisticated approach.

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence, but the simplicity and directness of the strategy (""If I got -50 I would click on the same partner again and move on to a different one if I got -50 again"") imply a level of certainty about their approach. The higher scores reflect this implied confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows an understanding of the task's basic requirement to switch strategies based on success rates, though the explanation lacks depth. The probability leans towards ""Adequate"" as the participant grasps the task's nature but does not elaborate on the rules or structure in detail.

**Judgment:** The participant indicates forming a plan to stick with a successful option and switch upon failure. This shows a clear judgment process, though not highly detailed or sophisticated, hence a higher probability towards ""Good.""

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the switch when options ""seemed to become unsuccessful."" This indicates some evaluation of strategy effectiveness, warranting a higher score in ""Good"" due to the reflection on strategy performance.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule of sticking with successful choices and switching from unsuccessful ones. This strategy is somewhat clearly articulated, suggesting a ""Good"" score, with some probability towards ""Exemplary"" due to the clarity in decision-making.

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt but implies some level of certainty in their approach by stating a clear strategy and sticking to it. This suggests a higher score in ""Confidence,"" leaning towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"" as they seem sure of their approach despite the brief response."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows an understanding of the task's goal and structure by identifying a strategy based on choosing a ""reliable person"" until failure. The response indicates a grasp of the task's probabilistic nature and the need for strategy adjustment, suggesting a score leaning towards good comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy formulation (""chose the reliable person till the person failed me"") reflects a clear plan of action, indicating judgment in their approach. The clarity and simplicity of the strategy suggest a higher score, but the lack of detailed reasoning about why this strategy was chosen keeps it from the highest rating.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly evaluating its outcome (""till the person failed me""), which shows some level of strategy assessment. However, there is no deep analysis or reasoning about why the strategy worked or didn't, which prevents a higher score.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (""Then I guessed the next reliable person""), indicating a clear final decision-making process. The simplicity and clarity in the final decision push the score towards the higher end.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and straightforward response, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty about their strategy or understanding, suggests a high level of confidence. The lack of questioning or hesitation supports a high score in this dimension."

- **Comprehension**: The participant shows some understanding of the task by mentioning the method of ""giving each one a couple clicks"" and observing outcomes. However, the explanation lacks depth about the task's structure or goals, suggesting a score leaning towards ""Adequate.""
- **Judgment**: The participant indicates a basic strategy of clicking each option a few times, which shows some planning. The clarity and depth are not fully developed, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.
- **Evaluation**: The reflection includes a brief evaluation (""i got more 100s from continued clicking""), suggesting some reflection on the strategy's effectiveness. This warrants a balance between ""Adequate"" and ""Good.""
- **Final Decision**: The participant mentions a shift in strategy towards the end, which implies some decision-making process. The description is not very detailed, so scores are distributed more towards ""Adequate"" and ""Good.""
- **Confidence**: The participant's confidence in their strategy is implied but not explicitly stated, leading to uncertainty. The reflection suggests some confidence in the effectiveness of their approach, but it's not strongly articulated, leaning towards an ""Adequate"" score."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows an understanding of the task as they mention picking up on patterns to make guesses. However, the depth of understanding specific rules or structure is not explicitly detailed, hence a higher probability in the middle range.
- **Judgment**: The participant clearly states a strategy (observing and using patterns), indicating some planning and hypothesis formation. The response leans towards a good understanding of how to approach the task, but lacks detailed sophistication about how these decisions were formed.
- **Evaluation**: The participant mentions using the strategy throughout the game but does not deeply reflect on its effectiveness or reasons for its success or failure, thus scoring higher in the middle range.
- **Final Decision**: The participant consistently applied their strategy of watching for patterns, as stated. This shows a clear decision strategy, but the reflection lacks a sophisticated explanation of why this strategy was maintained throughout, justifying a higher score towards the upper middle.
- **Confidence**: The participant does not express explicit confidence or doubt about their strategy; however, the fact that they did not change the strategy suggests some level of confidence. The probabilities are skewed towards higher confidence but not at the highest level due to the lack of explicit expression of certainty."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's statement shows a minimal understanding of the task, as indicated by the vague reference to ""the game"" and a lack of clear articulation of the task rules or goals. The probability distribution reflects a low to moderate comprehension, with a slight inclination towards rudimentary understanding.

**Judgment:** The participant mentions a strategy (""went with who I thought was the hot hand""), which indicates some level of planning or hypothesis formation. The distribution leans towards an adequate understanding, with some probability allocated to a good level, suggesting that while the strategy is mentioned, the depth or rationale behind it isn't fully explored.

**Evaluation:** The participant does not reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy or why it might have worked or failed, leading to a high probability of scoring low in this dimension. The reflection lacks any evaluative comments about the outcomes of their decisions.

**Final Decision:** The participant does mention a decision strategy (""the hot hand""), but does not elaborate on its consistency or its application throughout the task. The distribution suggests a rudimentary to adequate description, with some uncertainty about how consistently this strategy was applied.

**Confidence:** The participant's expression of forgetting the game and a casual mention of their strategy without any assertive or confident language suggests a high probability of low confidence in their approach or understanding of the task. The high score for ""Absent"" reflects this lack of confidence and certainty."

Confidence: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8]  

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant's reflection indicates a basic understanding of the task's goal, which was to stick with a successful option. However, there is no explicit mention of understanding the rules or structure beyond this. The score leans towards ""Adequate"" due to the implicit understanding shown by sticking to a working strategy.

**Judgment:**  
The participant formed a basic plan to stick with the partner that was working. This shows some level of judgment but lacks depth or a sophisticated approach to strategy formation. The score is weighted towards ""Good"" as there is clear evidence of a plan, albeit a simple one.

**Evaluation:**  
The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly suggesting it worked since they did not feel the need to change it. This shows some evaluation but not a deep analysis of why it worked or didn't. The score is weighted towards ""Good"" due to the implicit evaluation present.

**Final Decision:**  
The participant clearly states that they did not switch strategies and stuck with their initial plan throughout the task. This shows a very consistent decision-making process. The score is heavily weighted towards ""Exemplary"" as the participant was very consistent in their approach.

**Confidence:**  
The participant's statement shows a high level of confidence in their chosen strategy, evidenced by their commitment to sticking with it throughout the task without switching. The score is weighted towards ""Exemplary"" due to the strong expression of confidence in their approach."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's statement indicates a basic understanding of the task as they engaged in a method of selection, albeit random. The mention of sticking with choices suggests some grasp of the task's structure, hence a moderate score leaning towards adequate understanding.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan (choosing at random and then sticking with choices), which shows some level of strategic thinking, though not sophisticated or deeply reasoned. This warrants a score leaning towards adequate.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection lacks any substantive evaluation of the effectiveness of their strategy, as they did not comment on whether the strategy worked or why. This dimension is largely absent, thus a high probability for a score of 0.

**Final Decision:** The participant mentions sticking with their choices, which indicates a decision strategy, albeit a simple one. This suggests a clearer final decision-making process, warranting a score leaning towards good.

**Confidence:** The participant's language (""not really,"" ""just looked at random"") expresses doubt and minimal confidence in their approach. This suggests a lower score in confidence, leaning towards rudimentary."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's mechanics by recognizing the negative outcome (-50) and responding to it. However, the reflection lacks depth in explaining the overall goal or rules beyond reacting to negative stimuli, suggesting a score leaning towards ""Adequate"" but not fully comprehensive.

**Judgment:** The participant clearly formed a plan based on the frequency of negative outcomes, indicating a strategy based on observed patterns. This demonstrates more than rudimentary planning, hence the higher probabilities towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary.""

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by indicating a switch when encountering frequent negative outcomes, showing some evaluation of strategy effectiveness. This reflection is somewhat clear but not deeply analytical, supporting a higher score in ""Good.""

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule (switching decks upon frequent negative outcomes), which shows a clear decision strategy. The reflection, however, does not elaborate on why this strategy was chosen over others, which might have warranted a full ""Exemplary"" score.

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their strategy, but the use of a consistent rule and the absence of questioning their approach suggest a moderate to high level of confidence. The probabilities are therefore higher towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary."""

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows a basic understanding of the task by focusing on the partner that provided the highest points, indicating they grasped the goal of maximizing points. The response suggests a good understanding but lacks depth in explaining the task structure or rules beyond point maximization.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of consistently choosing the highest point-giving partner indicates a clear plan or hypothesis was formed. The simplicity of the strategy and lack of detailed reasoning suggest a higher score but not the highest.
- **Evaluation**: The participant did not reflect on whether their strategy worked beyond the initial choice, nor did they provide reasons for the strategy's effectiveness or lack thereof. This dimension is largely absent in their reflection.
- **Final Decision**: The participant clearly states their consistent decision strategy, which was to always choose the partner giving 100 points. This shows a high level of clarity in their final decision-making process.

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows a reasonable understanding of the task dynamics by distinguishing between a ""bad round"" and intentional ""sabotage."" This indicates a grasp of the task's probabilistic nature and the need to interpret outcomes, scoring higher in comprehension.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy formulation, deciding when to switch based on the frequency of negative outcomes, shows a planned approach. This reflects a good level of judgment in hypothesizing and planning actions.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on their strategy's effectiveness, particularly noting their impatience and increased frequency of switching, which shows some evaluation but lacks depth on why specific strategies were more or less effective.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a change in strategy during the task, indicating some consistency in applying a new rule based on their experiences. However, the reflection lacks a clear, final decision strategy that was consistently applied throughout, suggesting a moderate score.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant seems to have a basic understanding of the task rules, as indicated by their strategy of sticking with one option until it results in a loss. However, the reflection lacks depth in explaining the structure or goal of the task beyond this strategy. This suggests an adequate to good understanding, hence the distribution leaning towards scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy implies a planned approach (sticking with one choice until it fails), showing some level of hypothesis formation about how to act. The reflection suggests a more than rudimentary understanding but lacks sophisticated insight into the strategic planning, thus the higher probabilities for scores 2 and 3, with some possibility of a 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by indicating a switch upon failure, which shows some evaluation. However, there is no deep analysis of why this strategy was chosen or its effectiveness across different scenarios, which would have warranted a higher score. The probabilities are distributed with a lean towards scores 2 and 3, acknowledging some evaluation but not in-depth.

**Final Decision:** The reflection indicates a consistent rule or decision strategy (sticking with one choice until it fails). This strategy is clearly articulated, suggesting a good to exemplary understanding of their final decision-making process. The probabilities are therefore higher for scores 3 and 4.

**Confidence:** The participant's reflection does not explicitly state confidence levels, but the straightforward statement of their strategy suggests a reasonable level of certainty about their approach. The absence of doubt or uncertainty in their language supports a distribution leaning towards higher scores (2, 3, and 4), indicating some confidence in their strategy."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's structure by attempting to track the ratio of failures to successes, indicating some grasp of the probabilistic nature of the task. However, the reflection lacks depth in fully explaining the task rules or goals, hence a higher probability in the middle range.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a hypothesis about the behavior of the characters based on their observations, which shows a clear judgment process. The reflection indicates a thoughtful approach to decision-making, especially as the task progressed and became more complex.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the interrelated behavior of the characters and adjusting their choices accordingly. This shows a good level of evaluation, but it lacks a deeper analysis of why certain strategies worked or failed, hence a higher score in the middle range.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a decision strategy that evolved as the task became more difficult, indicating a thoughtful approach to adapting their strategy based on the task's demands. This shows a good level of strategic consistency and adaptation.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses some doubt about their initial strategy (""but was probably wrong""), showing awareness of their uncertainty. This indicates a moderate level of confidence, with a higher probability towards the lower end of the scale, reflecting their self-doubt."

- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of sticking with consistent results indicates a planned approach, though not deeply elaborated. The response leans more towards a clear strategy (score 3), but lacks depth for a higher score.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not provide much reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy beyond a simple negative answer to changing strategies. This suggests some evaluation but not in-depth, leading to a higher probability for score 2.
- **Final Decision**: The participant clearly states their decision strategy (""stick with the people who didnt vary with their result the most""), indicating a consistent rule applied. This is more aligned with scores 3 and 4, showing a clear decision-making process.

Rationale: The participant's response ""No ; not really"" is extremely brief and lacks any substantive content that could be evaluated across the five dimensions of the Metacognitive Prompting (MP) framework. This response does not provide any evidence that the participant understood the task rules, structure, or goal (Comprehension), nor does it indicate that they formed any hypothesis or plan about how to act (Judgment). There is no reflection on whether their strategy worked or why, which affects the Evaluation score. Similarly, they did not describe any consistent rule or decision strategy they ultimately applied (Final Decision), and there is no expression of certainty or doubt about their approach or understanding (Confidence). Therefore, the probabilities are heavily weighted towards a score of 0 for each dimension, indicating an absence of evidence for metacognitive reflection in the participant's response."

- **Comprehension**: The participant shows some understanding of the task's reward system (returning to a choice that previously yielded a positive outcome). However, the response lacks depth in explaining the overall goal or rules of the task, suggesting a moderate level of comprehension.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of returning to a previously rewarding choice indicates some level of planning or hypothesis formation. The clarity isn't deep, but there's evidence of a basic strategy, hence a higher probability towards a good score.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's reflection lacks a detailed assessment of whether their strategy was effective overall, only providing a minimal hint at re-evaluating their choices (""no""). This suggests some evaluation but not deeply insightful or comprehensive.
- **Final Decision**: The strategy described (""kept going back to the same partner if I got +100"") shows a consistent rule applied during the task, leaning towards a good to exemplary understanding of a decision strategy, despite the brevity of the response.
- **Confidence**: The participant's confidence in their strategy is not clearly articulated. The terse nature of the response and the inclusion of ""no"" suggest some doubt or reconsideration, indicating moderate confidence at best."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant seems to understand the basic structure of the task, as indicated by their strategy of sticking to one option until it fails multiple times. This shows an understanding of the task's probabilistic nature and the need for a strategy. The response suggests a good grasp but lacks a detailed explanation of the task rules or goals, hence the distribution leaning towards a higher score but not the highest.

**Judgment:**  
The participant clearly formed a strategy (ascending to descending order, sticking to one choice until failure), indicating some level of planning and hypothesis formation about how to act. The clarity in describing a specific approach suggests a good level of judgment, but not exemplary, as the strategy is somewhat basic and not deeply explained.

**Evaluation:**  
The participant does reflect minimally on the effectiveness of their strategy by mentioning sticking to one option until it fails multiple times. However, there is no deep analysis or reasoning about why this strategy was chosen or its effectiveness beyond the basic rule-following, leading to a moderate score.

**Final Decision:**  
The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (sticking to one choice until it fails multiple times). This shows a clear final decision strategy, which is somewhat sophisticated in its adherence despite failures. The response indicates a good to exemplary understanding of sticking with a decision rule, hence the higher scores.

**Confidence:**  
The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their approach. The lack of explicit confidence or doubt expressions leads to a moderate score, as the strategy itself implies some level of confidence in sticking with one option until it fails repeatedly. However, the absence of direct statements about confidence or self-assessment prevents the highest scores."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by mentioning specific outcomes (100 and -50) that guide their decisions. The response indicates a grasp of the task structure but lacks a detailed explanation of the overall goal, hence the higher probabilities for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant clearly states a decision rule based on the outcomes, which reflects some planning or hypothesis formation about how to act. The clarity and simplicity of the rule suggest a good level of judgment, leading to higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant does not explicitly reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy beyond a simple adherence to it, indicated by the statement of sticking with the strategy. There is minimal reflection on why this strategy might work or not, leading to a higher probability for score 2.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule they applied throughout the task, which is a clear decision strategy. However, there is no indication of any adjustments or nuanced decision-making based on changing conditions or additional insights, which justifies a higher probability for scores 3 and 4.

**Confidence:** The participant's statement, ""No, I stayed with that one,"" suggests a high level of confidence in their chosen strategy, as they did not consider changing it despite potential fluctuations in outcomes. This is reflected in the higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4, indicating a strong belief in their approach."

- **Comprehension**: The participant's response indicates a basic understanding of the task's goal (to click for positive points), but lacks depth in explaining the structure or rules. The probabilities reflect a good understanding but not exemplary, as the details are minimal.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy (""Click the one that continued to give me positive points"") shows a clear plan, but it's quite basic. The higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4 reflect that a plan was indeed formed and followed.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's brief response suggests minimal reflection on the effectiveness of the strategy, indicated by a higher probability for a score of 2. There's some evaluation implied in the continuation of the strategy, but it's not deeply analyzed.
- **Final Decision**: The participant seems to have stuck with a consistent strategy throughout, as indicated by the response ""No"" to changing strategies. This suggests a higher score for having a clear decision strategy.
- **Confidence**: The simplicity and directness of the response suggest a high level of confidence in the chosen approach, reflected in the higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4. The participant does not express doubt or uncertainty."

**Rationale:**
- **Comprehension:** The participant shows an understanding of the task by recognizing the need to ""test the waters"" of each option, indicating some grasp of the task's trial-and-error nature. However, the depth of understanding specific rules or structure isn't fully articulated, leading to a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.
- **Judgment:** The participant's strategy of moving on when things seemed to be going badly suggests a clear plan or hypothesis was formed about how to act, leaning towards a ""Good"" score. The mention of testing each option also supports some level of strategic planning.
- **Evaluation:** The reflection on the strategy's effectiveness is minimal and vague (""moved on when I thought it was going badly""), suggesting some evaluation but not deeply analyzed or explained, thus a split between ""Rudimentary"" and ""Adequate.""
- **Final Decision:** The participant indicates a consistent approach throughout the task (""my strategy was the same throughout the whole thing""), suggesting a clear decision strategy was applied, leaning towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"" as they stuck with their plan.
- **Confidence:** The participant's statement about maintaining the same strategy throughout with no indication of doubt suggests confidence in their approach, warranting a higher score towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary."""

Confidence: [0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.0]  

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response is extremely brief and lacks clear evidence of understanding the task's rules, structure, or goal. The phrase ""just try to find best person"" is vague and does not explicitly show comprehension of the task specifics. However, there is a minimal indication that they grasped the idea of choosing among options, hence the distribution leaning towards lower scores but not completely absent.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy (""just try to find best person"") suggests a rudimentary plan or hypothesis about how to approach the task, but it is not detailed or well-articulated. The lack of depth in the strategy description leads to a higher probability for lower scores.

**Evaluation:** There is very minimal reflection on whether their strategy worked or why, indicated by the terse ""no"" at the end of the response. This suggests some level of evaluation but is far from clear or in-depth. The score distribution reflects this minimal and unclear evaluation.

**Final Decision:** The participant does not describe a consistent rule or decision strategy they ultimately applied in any detailed manner. The response is too brief and lacks detail, leading to uncertainty about whether a consistent strategy was used throughout the task. The probabilities are spread across lower scores to reflect this uncertainty.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their approach or understanding is not explicitly stated. The brief and somewhat ambiguous response does not convey strong certainty or doubt. The distribution slightly favors lower scores, reflecting the lack of clear expression of confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task by recognizing the need to track which option was performing best. However, the reflection lacks depth in explaining the rules or structure of the task, suggesting a moderate level of comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant indicates some form of strategy by trying to track the best-performing option, which shows a plan of action. The mention of attempting to find a pattern, despite its change, suggests a somewhat thoughtful approach, but not highly sophisticated or detailed.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by acknowledging that the perceived patterns kept changing. This shows an awareness of the strategy's outcome and its limitations, indicating a good level of evaluation.

**Final Decision:** The participant's strategy seems to have been somewhat consistent, focusing on tracking the best option, despite the changing patterns. This suggests a rule or decision strategy was applied, though not rigidly, as adjustments were considered when patterns seemed to change.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses a mix of certainty in their approach to track the best option and doubt about the changing patterns. This blend of confidence and reflective doubt suggests a higher score in this dimension, indicating a nuanced understanding of their own metacognitive processes."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows an understanding of the task's feedback mechanism by adjusting their choice after receiving two negative outcomes. The response is somewhat clear but lacks depth, suggesting a moderate understanding of the task structure.

**Judgment:** The participant explicitly mentions a decision rule (""if I get two negatives in a row, try different stack""), indicating a planned approach to the task. This demonstrates a good level of judgment, with some sophistication in forming a hypothesis about how to act.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy is minimal and indirect. The brief affirmation (""yes"") at the end might imply some level of evaluation, but it's not clear or detailed.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a specific rule they applied consistently (""if I get two negatives in a row, try different stack""), which shows a good level of clarity in their final decision-making process. The response suggests a thoughtful application of a strategy, though not highly sophisticated.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their strategy or understanding of the task is not explicitly stated and can only be inferred indirectly. The simplicity and brevity of the response suggest some uncertainty, hence the higher probabilities for lower scores."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's goal (selecting individuals based on positive results) and the structure (switching when results turn negative). The response indicates a moderate level of understanding, hence the higher probabilities for scores 2, 3, and 4.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy formulation (""selecting the individual who seemed to give positive results"") shows some planning and hypothesis generation. The clarity and thoughtfulness in the approach suggest a good level of judgment, leading to higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their strategy by acknowledging the need to switch when results turn negative, but does not deeply analyze why the strategy worked or didn't. This warrants a moderate score, with the highest probability at score 2.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (""trying others when that one became negative""), indicating a clear final decision-making process. The response leans towards a higher score, with probabilities favoring scores 3 and 4.

**Confidence:** The participant does not express strong certainty or doubt about their approach, but the brief reflection suggests some level of confidence in understanding and applying the strategy. The distribution reflects moderate confidence, with the highest probability at score 2."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a clear understanding of the task's structure and goal, as they describe using feedback (-50's and +100's) to guide their decisions. The response indicates a good grasp of the task rules but lacks a detailed explanation of the entire task structure, hence the distribution leaning towards higher scores but not the highest.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan based on the outcomes they observed, which shows some level of strategic thinking. They decided to switch decks upon observing negative outcomes, indicating a hypothesis-driven approach to maximize rewards. The judgment is clear but not deeply sophisticated, thus a higher probability towards a score of 3.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by monitoring the outcomes and adjusting based on what they observed. This shows a good level of self-evaluation, as they are assessing the strategy's success based on consistent positive feedback. The response leans towards a higher score due to the clear rationale behind their strategy adjustments.

**Final Decision:** The participant claims to have stuck with the same strategy throughout, which indicates a strong adherence to a consistent decision-making rule once they established it. This shows a high level of commitment to their chosen strategy, deserving a high score.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses a clear and straightforward approach without indicating any doubt about their strategy or understanding of the task. They seem confident in the approach they took, as evidenced by their consistent application of the strategy and the lack of expressed uncertainty. This warrants a higher score in confidence."

They demonstrate a clear grasp of the task's probabilistic nature and the need to adapt based on outcomes, which suggests a score leaning towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary.""

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy formulation is quite sophisticated, involving conditional reasoning based on the outcomes of previous rounds. They planned their actions based on specific conditions (back-to-back losses or two out of three losses), indicating a high level of judgment in their approach.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on their strategy's effectiveness implicitly by sticking to it throughout the task, suggesting it worked for them. They also mention trying out another option occasionally to test if conditions had changed, showing some level of strategy evaluation.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy they applied throughout the task, with occasional deviations to test other options. This indicates a strong and consistent decision-making process, deserving a higher score.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses a moderate level of certainty about their approach, sticking to a primary strategy throughout the task and only occasionally deviating to test alternatives.

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant seems to have a basic understanding of the task as they mention testing all options to find the best one. However, the depth of understanding the task rules or structure isn't fully clear, hence a higher probability in the middle range.
- **Judgment**: The participant indicates a clear plan (""test all of the partner's until i find the best one again""), suggesting a formulated hypothesis about how to act. The clarity and thoughtfulness in planning are somewhat evident, leading to a higher score in the 'Good' range.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not provide a detailed reflection on whether their strategy worked or why, but the mention of sticking to the same strategy implies some level of evaluation. The response is not very detailed, so the score is higher in the 'Adequate' range.
- **Final Decision**: The participant states they did not switch strategies, indicating a consistent rule or decision strategy was applied. The clarity in this decision is somewhat evident, leading to a higher score in the 'Good' to 'Exemplary' range.
- **Confidence**: The participant's confidence in their approach is implied by their decision to stick with the same strategy throughout, suggesting some level of certainty. However, explicit expressions of confidence are lacking, so the score is higher in the 'Good' range."

- **Comprehension**: The participant's reflection indicates a basic understanding of the task rules, as they mention sticking with a choice until it changed. However, the explanation lacks depth, suggesting a score between adequate and good. The participant seems to understand the reversal aspect of the task but does not elaborate on the structure or goal in detail.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a basic plan (sticking with the 100 until it changed), which shows some judgment. The clarity and depth of the plan are somewhat limited, but there is evidence of a strategy, hence a higher score towards good.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's reflection on whether their strategy worked is minimal and lacks depth. They did not elaborate on why they chose the strategy or its effectiveness, leading to a lower score in this dimension.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (""stayed with the 100 until it changed""), which is somewhat clear. However, the strategy's sophistication or comprehensive insight is limited, suggesting a score leaning towards good.
- **Confidence**: The participant does not express strong certainty or doubt about their approach. The response to the second question (""no"") might indicate some confidence in not needing to switch strategies, but this is not explicitly linked to their understanding or strategy effectiveness. Thus, the score is centered around adequate."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's need for adaptability (not moving on too quickly or staying too long), indicating some grasp of the task structure. The probabilities reflect a good understanding but not a comprehensive one.
- **Judgment**: The participant explicitly mentions a strategy (waiting for three wrongs before switching), which shows clear planning and hypothesis formation. The higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4 reflect this clear articulation of a strategy.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly suggesting it was a response to failure (""when we started failing""). This shows some evaluation but lacks depth on why this strategy was chosen or its effectiveness, hence the higher scores in the middle range.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule they applied throughout the task, which is a clear decision strategy. The probabilities lean towards higher scores due to the clarity and consistency of the strategy mentioned.
- **Confidence**: The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their strategy, but the use of a clear rule suggests some level of confidence.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant clearly understood the task rules and goals, as evidenced by their strategy to stick with the partner who contributed the most points and switch when necessary. The reflection shows a good grasp of the task structure, hence the high scores towards 4.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a clear hypothesis about sticking with the most rewarding partner and switching when performance dropped. This indicates a well-thought-out plan, meriting a higher score towards 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflected on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the times they needed to switch due to a partner's decreased performance. This shows a good level of self-evaluation, justifying scores leaning towards 4.

**Final Decision:** The participant described a consistent rule or decision strategy, sticking primarily with one partner and only switching under specific conditions. This clear and consistent strategy warrants a high score, predominantly a 4.

**Confidence:** The participant expressed a strong sense of certainty in their approach, committing to their strategy throughout the task and only altering it under specific circumstances. This demonstrates high confidence, supporting a score leaning towards 4."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant indicates a basic understanding of the task by attempting to identify a pattern or odds, suggesting they grasped the probabilistic nature of the task. However, the reflection lacks depth in explaining the rules or structure beyond this, hence a higher probability for a score of 2 (Adequate).

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy to test for patterns shows an initial plan or hypothesis about how to approach the task. The reflection suggests some clarity in their approach, but not a sophisticated strategy formulation, leading to a higher score in the range of 3 (Good).

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by acknowledging their inability to discern a clear pattern, indicating some evaluation. However, the depth of this reflection is limited, thus a higher score in the range of 3 (Good) seems appropriate.

**Final Decision:** The participant does not clearly articulate a consistent rule or decision strategy they ultimately applied, as they mention the task seemed random. This suggests some uncertainty and inconsistency in their final approach, leading to a higher probability for a score of 2 (Adequate).

**Confidence:** The participant expresses doubt about their understanding and the effectiveness of their strategy (""I couldn't figure it out. It seemed mostly random""), indicating low confidence. This is reflected in the higher probabilities for lower scores (1 and 2)."

**Rationale:**
- **Comprehension:** The participant's response ""click till I found 100"" suggests a rudimentary understanding of the task's goal (to reach a score of 100), but lacks depth or clarity about the structure or rules beyond that. Hence, a higher probability is given to a score of 1.
- **Judgment:** The strategy mentioned is extremely basic and shows minimal planning or hypothesis formation (""click till I found 100""). This indicates a rudimentary level of judgment, leading to a high probability for a score of 1.
- **Evaluation:** The participant's response does not reflect on the effectiveness of the strategy or why it might have worked or not, indicated by the absence of any evaluative language. This leads to a high probability for a score of 0.
- **Final Decision:** The strategy described (""click till I found 100"") is consistent but simplistic, indicating a rudimentary level of decision-making. This results in a high probability for a score of 1.
- **Confidence:** The participant does not express any certainty or doubt about their approach explicitly. The lack of any confidence-related language, combined with the simplistic strategy, suggests a high probability for a score of 2, assuming some implicit confidence in the chosen method."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task by mentioning the strategy of ""clicking the same card in a row"" and recognizing the need to switch strategies. The response indicates some grasp of the task's structure but lacks depth in explaining the rules or goals explicitly. Hence, a higher probability is given to scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan (""max out by clicking the same card"") and later decided to switch strategies. This shows some level of planning and hypothesis formation, warranting a higher score in the judgment dimension, with a significant probability assigned to a score of 3.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the difficulty in scoring ""serial baskets in a row,"" leading to a strategy change. This reflection on strategy effectiveness suggests a good level of evaluation, thus a higher probability for scores 3 and 4.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy they ultimately applied, which was to alternate between cards in the last rounds. This clear description of a final decision strategy justifies a higher probability for scores 3 and 4.

**Confidence:** The participant's expression shows some uncertainty about their approach, particularly in the effectiveness of their initial strategy, leading to a change. This mixed level of confidence is reflected in the spread across scores 2 and 3, with some probability also given to scores 1 and 4 to account for the ambiguity in their confidence level."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's goal (finding the option with the highest reward), but the explanation lacks depth about the structure or rules of the task. The probabilities reflect a mostly adequate understanding with some room for more clarity.
- **Judgment**: The participant describes a strategy of sticking with one choice until it no longer yields the highest reward, indicating some planning and hypothesis formation. The higher probabilities for scores 2 and 3 reflect this clear but not deeply sophisticated strategy formation.
- **Evaluation**: The participant mentions switching strategies a couple of times, suggesting some reflection on the strategy's effectiveness. However, the reflection on why strategies were changed or how they performed is minimal, leading to a higher probability for an adequate score.
- **Final Decision**: The participant indicates a consistent rule of sticking with one option until it fails, which shows some decision-making strategy. The probabilities lean towards a good understanding but not exemplary, as the strategy is somewhat simplistic.

- **Judgment**: The participant's decision to stick with a single strategy indicates some form of planning or hypothesis about the task's demands. However, the lack of detail about the nature of the strategy or its formulation leads to moderate probabilities across lower and middle scores.
- **Evaluation**: The reflection lacks a clear assessment of the strategy's effectiveness or reasons for its success or failure. The response hints at some evaluation by the mere fact of strategy persistence, suggesting a belief in its effectiveness, but this is not explicitly stated.
- **Final Decision**: The participant clearly states that they did not switch strategies, indicating a strong adherence to a final decision. This is reflected in higher probabilities for higher scores, acknowledging a consistent decision strategy.

- **Judgment**: The reflection implies a rudimentary form of judgment in deciding to treat choices as random, which shows some level of decision-making but lacks sophistication or strategic depth. Thus, scores of 1 and 2 are more probable.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy or provide reasons for their choices, suggesting a high probability for a score of 0.
- **Final Decision**: The participant indicates a consistent approach (random choice), but this is not a strategic decision in a conventional sense. This warrants a moderate score, leaning towards 2.

- **Judgment**: There is no evidence of forming any hypothesis or plan, as the participant explicitly states they used ""no specific strategy.""
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not reflect on the effectiveness of their approach, likely because they did not apply any discernible strategy.
- **Final Decision**: The response lacks any description of a consistent rule or decision strategy, aligning with their initial statement of having no strategy.

Rationale: The participant's reflection is quite brief and lacks explicit detail across all dimensions, making it challenging to assign high scores. 

- **Comprehension**: The participant's understanding of the task rules or goals is not clearly articulated. The phrase used suggests a general strategy but does not confirm a deep understanding of the task specifics. Hence, a slightly higher probability is given to lower scores.
  
- **Judgment**: The reflection implies a strategy (""gave the better person a second chance"") but lacks depth or explanation about how this strategy was formed or its relevance to the task structure. The probabilities lean towards lower scores due to the lack of detailed planning or hypothesis formation.

- **Evaluation**: There is minimal reflection on the effectiveness of the strategy or reasons for its success or failure. The participant does not provide insights into adjustments based on task outcomes, leading to higher probabilities for lower scores.

- **Final Decision**: The participant mentions a consistent rule (""always gave the better person a second chance""), but it's unclear how this was applied throughout the task or adapted in response to changing conditions. The score probabilities suggest some recognition of a decision strategy but not a strong or clear application.

- **Confidence**: The participant's confidence in their strategy or understanding of the task is not explicitly stated. The phrase ""no"" at the end might indicate some doubt, but this is speculative. The probabilities reflect uncertainty about the participant's confidence level.

Overall, the reflection lacks depth and detail, which restricts higher scoring across the dimensions. The probabilities reflect a balance between recognizing some level of strategic thinking and the absence of detailed metacognitive insight."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows a basic understanding of the task by identifying that it involves selecting among options that provide points. However, the depth of understanding the task's structure or rules isn't fully demonstrated, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.
- **Judgment**: The participant indicates a simple strategy based on observation (""the 2 people that seemed to give points the most""), suggesting some form of planning or hypothesis formation. This is not highly sophisticated but shows some judgment, leaning towards a ""Good"" score.
- **Evaluation**: There is no reflection on the effectiveness of the strategy or any reasoning about why it might have worked or not, which suggests a high probability for an ""Absent"" score.
- **Final Decision**: The participant does not describe changing strategies and implies sticking to a consistent rule, though not elaborated in depth. This suggests a higher score towards ""Good"" as they maintained a consistent approach.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief and casual response (""; No"") to the strategy change and the simplistic strategy description suggest some uncertainty or minimal self-assurance about the approach, leading to a higher probability for ""Adequate""."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant clearly understood the task rules and structure, as evidenced by their strategy of switching decks based on the frequency of negative results. The reflection shows a good grasp of the task's goal, leaning towards an exemplary understanding.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a clear hypothesis about how to act, which involved switching decks based on specific conditions (two negative results in a row or a few negatives within a short span). This indicates a well-thought-out plan, meriting a high score.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflected on the effectiveness of their strategy, noting occasional deviations from it. This shows a good level of self-awareness and evaluation, though not entirely comprehensive, hence the balance between good and exemplary.

**Final Decision:** The participant described a consistent rule for decision-making, with slight variations in its application. This shows a good to exemplary level of clarity in their final decision-making process.

**Confidence:** The participant expressed a degree of certainty about their approach, tempered by acknowledgment of occasional deviations. This mixture of confidence and self-awareness suggests a score leaning towards the higher end, indicating thoughtful restraint."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows some understanding of the task as they identified that option #2 seemed the best choice after extensive checking. This indicates a basic grasp of the task's goal (to find the best choice), but lacks depth in explaining the structure or rules explicitly. Hence, a higher probability is given to scores 2 and 3.
- **Judgment**: The participant's statement about extensively checking each option before deciding on #2 suggests a planned approach, indicating some level of judgment. The reflection, however, lacks detailed explanation of the hypothesis formation process, thus scores 3 and 4 are more probable but not fully exemplary.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not provide a clear reflection on why they believe #2 was the best choice beyond its initial selection, nor do they discuss the outcomes of their choice in detail. This suggests a moderate level of evaluation, leaning towards score 2.
- **Final Decision**: The participant clearly states a final decision to stick with choice #2, indicating a relatively strong final decision-making process. The lack of detailed rationale for sticking with this decision throughout the task or adjustments made suggests a score leaning towards 4 but not fully exemplary.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief response and the lack of explicit confidence or doubt about their strategy or understanding suggest a moderate level of confidence. They do not express strong certainty or doubt, leading to a higher probability for score 2 and 3."

Rationale:  
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows some understanding of the task by mentioning a specific strategy of playing each successful partner multiple times before switching. However, the explanation lacks depth and clarity about the overall goal or rules of the task, suggesting a score leaning towards ""Adequate.""
- **Judgment**: The participant describes a specific action plan (playing each successful partner 3 or 4 times), indicating some form of hypothesis about how to act. The clarity is somewhat limited, so a score leaning towards ""Adequate"" is appropriate.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not clearly reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy or why it worked or didn't work, only providing a minimal indication of strategy use without evaluation. This suggests a score between ""Rudimentary"" and ""Adequate.""
- **Final Decision**: The participant mentions a decision strategy (switching after 3 or 4 successful plays), but does not elaborate on consistency or adjustments based on task feedback. This suggests a score leaning towards ""Good.""
- **Confidence**: The participant's expression shows some uncertainty and lack of confidence, especially with the terse addition of ""No"" at the end, which might indicate doubt about the strategy or its articulation. This suggests a score around ""Adequate."""

Rationale: The participant's reflection indicates a very low level of metacognitive engagement with the task. The response suggests a lack of understanding of the task's rules or goals, as indicated by the casual mention of just clicking until seeing a score of 100, which does not demonstrate comprehension of the task's structure or purpose. This is reflected in the high probability assigned to a score of 0 in the Comprehension dimension.

There is no evidence of forming a hypothesis or plan (Judgment), reflecting on the effectiveness of the strategy used (Evaluation), or describing a consistent decision-making strategy (Final Decision). The participant's response also shows a lack of confidence or certainty about their approach, as indicated by the casual and dismissive tone of the reflection. Thus, high probabilities are assigned to a score of 0 in these dimensions as well.

Overall, the participant's reflection lacks depth, insight, and engagement with the metacognitive aspects of the task, leading to low scores across all dimensions."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a good understanding of the task rules and structure, as they clearly describe sticking with a choice that yields positive results and changing strategy when it stops working. The response indicates a grasp of the task's probabilistic nature and the need for strategy adjustment, hence the higher scores towards the upper end.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a clear initial hypothesis (sticking with a rewarding choice) and later adapted their strategy when the conditions changed. This shows a good level of planning and hypothesis formation, justifying a higher score in the upper mid-range.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the shift from positive to negative outcomes, which prompted a strategy change. However, the depth of this reflection is somewhat limited, as there is no detailed analysis of why the initial strategy worked or failed beyond the obvious, hence a peak in the mid-range scores.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a clear shift in their decision-making process from a consistent choice to varying their selections in response to changing conditions. This indicates a good level of strategic adaptation, meriting a higher score in the upper mid-range.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their approach is implied rather than explicitly stated. They seem somewhat sure of their initial strategy but less certain about the effectiveness of the rapid changes in the last round. This uncertainty is reflected in the moderate scores, with a slight lean towards higher confidence."

The reflection indicates a grasp of the task rules and structure, hence the higher probabilities towards the upper end of the scale.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy formulation is evident as they decided to stick with a choice that was initially rewarding. The clarity in their plan suggests a good level of judgment, thus the higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the point at which the chosen option became less rewarding. This shows some evaluation, but it lacks depth regarding why this change might have occurred, leading to a balanced distribution with a slight lean towards the middle scores.
- **Final Decision**: The participant clearly states that they maintained their strategy throughout the game, indicating a consistent decision-making process. The reflection lacks details on any adjustments or nuanced decision rules, which justifies a higher probability for score 4 but not exclusively.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's goal, which is to maximize points by choosing the best partner. The reflection indicates an understanding of the task structure but lacks depth in explaining the rules or goals beyond the immediate strategy. Hence, a higher probability is given to scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan to switch partners when receiving negative points, indicating some level of strategic planning. The strategy is somewhat simplistic but shows a clear decision-making process, leading to a higher probability for scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant mentions a strategy but does not deeply reflect on its effectiveness beyond the immediate outcomes. There is minimal insight into why the strategy worked or didn't, thus a higher probability is assigned to score 2.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states that they did not change their strategy throughout the game, indicating a strong adherence to their initial decision. This shows a high level of consistency in their decision-making process, justifying a high probability for score 4.

- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on their strategy by mentioning the outcome of switching, which shows some evaluation. The probabilities lean towards higher scores because they not only used the strategy but also observed its outcomes, though the depth of insight into why it worked or didn't is not fully explored.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule they applied (switching after a loss), which is a clear decision strategy. The probabilities favor higher scores as this strategy is mentioned explicitly.
- **Confidence**: The participant shows some uncertainty and frustration (""I tried but everything I thought...""), indicating less confidence in their understanding or strategy effectiveness. This is reflected in the higher probabilities for lower scores."

- **Comprehension**: The participant's response suggests a minimal understanding of the task as they indicate no strategy was used. This implies some level of understanding (that a strategy could be formed), but it's rudimentary at best.
- **Judgment**: The participant's statement ""no strategy"" indicates an absence of any planning or hypothesis formation about how to approach the task.
- **Evaluation**: There is no reflection on the effectiveness of their approach or any reasoning provided about why they chose not to use a strategy.
- **Final Decision**: The participant indicates a consistent approach (""no strategy""), but this does not reflect a strategic decision in the context of the task, rather a lack of engagement.
- **Confidence**: The brief and definitive nature of the responses (""no strategy ; no"") suggests some level of confidence in their approach, albeit in a negative strategy. However, this confidence is not rooted in task engagement or strategic decision-making.

Overall, the participant's reflection lacks the depth and engagement necessary for higher scores in the metacognitive dimensions evaluated."

Rationale: The reflection provided, ""well ; good,"" is extremely brief and lacks any substantive content that can be evaluated across the five dimensions of the Metacognitive Prompting (MP) framework. 

- **Comprehension**: The response does not indicate any understanding of the task rules, structure, or goals. It is unclear if the participant comprehends what was required in the task.
- **Judgment**: There is no evidence of forming a hypothesis or plan about how to act during the task.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not reflect on whether their strategy worked or why, providing no insight into their thought process or strategy effectiveness.
- **Final Decision**: There is no description of a consistent rule or decision strategy that the participant might have applied.
- **Confidence**: The response does not express any certainty or doubt about their approach or understanding of the task.

Given the lack of information and the minimalistic nature of the response, the probabilities are heavily weighted towards a score of 0 (Absent) for all dimensions."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's statement ""Not really, I didn't see a pattern"" suggests a lack of understanding or awareness of the task's structure or rules, indicating a low comprehension. The probability is skewed towards a score of 1, as there is minimal expression of understanding.

**Judgment:** The participant indicates some form of decision-making process with ""I just tried to pick which one I thought would give me more points at the time."" This shows a basic hypothesis or plan, albeit not a sophisticated one, leading to a higher probability for a score of 2.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection lacks a detailed analysis of whether their strategy was effective, only hinting at a lack of pattern recognition. This suggests a rudimentary level of evaluation, hence a higher probability for a score of 1.

**Final Decision:** The participant's strategy seems consistent, albeit simple, as indicated by ""I just tried to pick which one I thought would give me more points at the time."" This suggests a clear, though not complex, decision strategy, leading to a high probability for a score of 2.

**Confidence:** The participant does not express strong certainty or doubt about their approach; the language used (""I don't think so"") suggests some uncertainty, but also a degree of resignation to their chosen method. This results in a higher probability for scores of 3 and 4, indicating moderate to good confidence."

**Rationale:**
- **Comprehension:** The participant's statement ""Just moving around trying to figure out where the 100 was"" suggests a basic understanding of the task's goal (to find the highest reward), but lacks depth in understanding the structure or rules. The probabilities reflect a leaning towards ""Adequate"" understanding with some clarity.
- **Judgment:** The participant's strategy seems rudimentary, indicated by ""Just moving around,"" which implies a trial-and-error approach without a sophisticated plan. The probabilities are skewed towards ""Rudimentary"" and ""Adequate"" as there is some indication of a strategy, albeit not well-formed.
- **Evaluation:** The participant's reflection lacks any substantive evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness or reasoning about why certain choices were made. The high probability for ""Absent"" reflects the lack of evaluative content in the reflection.
- **Final Decision:** The participant does not clearly articulate a consistent rule or decision strategy, as indicated by the vague strategy description. The probabilities suggest uncertainty about the presence of a final decision strategy, leaning towards ""Rudimentary.""
- **Confidence:** The participant's brief and non-committal response (""Yes"" to switching strategies) and the overall lack of depth in the reflection suggest low confidence. The probabilities are distributed to reflect uncertainty in the participant's confidence level, with no strong indication of high confidence."

Confidence: [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6]  

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by indicating a response to negative outcomes (-50s). The response suggests they grasped the task's structure of switching based on outcomes, but the depth of understanding is not fully clear. Hence, a higher probability is given to scores 2 and 3, indicating adequate to good comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of switching after receiving two negative outcomes indicates some level of planning or hypothesis formation. The clarity and depth of this strategy are somewhat evident, leading to a higher probability for scores 3 and 4, suggesting a good to exemplary judgment.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection lacks a detailed evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness beyond a simple action-reaction explanation. There is minimal reflection on why this strategy was chosen or its overall success, leading to a higher probability for score 2, indicating adequate evaluation.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states a consistent rule (""When a partner gave me two -50s, I would switch to another""), which shows a definitive decision strategy. The clarity and decisiveness in this statement are strong, leading to higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4, indicating a good to exemplary final decision.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and straightforward response, especially the confident ""Nope"" when asked about strategy switching, suggests a high level of certainty about their approach and understanding. This is reflected in the higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4, indicating good to exemplary confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant seems to have a basic understanding of the task as they mention sticking with a choice until a certain condition (betrayal) occurs twice. This suggests some grasp of the task's rules or structure, but the depth of understanding is not fully clear, hence a higher probability for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of staying with the same option until betrayed twice indicates a planned approach or hypothesis about how to act. The clarity and sophistication of this plan are moderately high, suggesting a higher probability for scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant does not explicitly reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy or why it might or might not have worked, only stating what they did. There is minimal reflection, thus a higher probability for scores 2 and 1.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (staying until betrayed twice), which is fairly clear and specific. This suggests a higher probability for scores 4 and 3, indicating a good to exemplary final decision-making process.

**Confidence:** The participant does not express much certainty or doubt about their approach; the response is somewhat ambiguous (""; no"" is unclear). This ambiguity leads to a spread across lower scores, with a slight lean towards lower confidence levels."

**Judgment:** The participant describes a clear strategy of following the person with the highest success probability, indicating some planning and hypothesis formation. The response suggests a good level of judgment, though not fully sophisticated or detailed.

**Evaluation:** The participant mentions changing the person when needed, which implies some level of strategy evaluation. However, there is no detailed reflection on why changes were made or how effective the strategy was, leading to a moderate score.

**Final Decision:** The participant's strategy seems consistent, as they stuck with one person until a change was deemed necessary. This shows a relatively clear decision-making process, though the lack of detail on how decisions were made prevents a full score.

**Confidence:** The participant does not express strong confidence or doubt explicitly. The brief and straightforward nature of the response suggests some certainty in their approach but lacks depth, leading to a moderate score in confidence."

- **Evaluation**: The participant's mention of allowing for negatives ""in case it's just a bad day"" suggests some reflection on the strategy's effectiveness under varying conditions, leading to a higher score in evaluation but not reaching a sophisticated level.
- **Final Decision**: The participant seems to have stuck with their initial strategy throughout, as indicated by the brief response. There's some indication of a consistent rule but not elaborated upon deeply, hence a higher score for 3.

- **Evaluation**: The participant's reflection on strategy effectiveness is implied but not deeply analyzed. They mention switching when a deck changes to minus, suggesting some evaluation, but without depth or reasoning about effectiveness.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule of switching decks upon negative changes, indicating some decision strategy. The response suggests a moderate to good clarity in their final decision-making process.
- **Confidence**: The participant's confidence in their strategy or understanding is not explicitly stated, leading to uncertainty. The reflection shows some doubt (indicated by the simplicity and brevity of the response), hence a higher score in the middle range."

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a good understanding of the task rules and structure by recognizing the need to stick with a choice until it no longer yields positive outcomes. The reflection indicates a grasp of the task's probabilistic nature, hence the scores leaning towards higher comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant clearly formed a hypothesis about sticking with a choice until it ceased to be beneficial, which shows a planned approach to the task. The reflection also hints at a broader understanding of the game's manipulable nature, suggesting a deeper level of strategic thinking.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by acknowledging the need to switch choices when a previously good choice becomes less effective. This shows a level of self-assessment and understanding of strategy performance.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy applied throughout the game, which was to stick with a choice until it was no longer beneficial. This strategy is clearly articulated and shows a rational approach to decision-making in the task.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses a mix of certainty in their chosen strategy and a philosophical doubt about the overall fairness or manipulability of the game. This combination of confidence in their method and skepticism about external factors influencing the game's outcome suggests a mature and nuanced understanding, justifying higher scores in this dimension."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by indicating a strategy of switching ""partners"" after consecutive failures. The use of specific conditions (two failures) suggests a moderate to good grasp of the task structure. The probabilities reflect a range from adequate to exemplary, leaning more towards a clear understanding.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy formulation, based on the occurrence of failures, indicates some planning and hypothesis generation. The reflection shows a transition in strategy, which is thoughtful and somewhat detailed, hence the higher probabilities for good and exemplary scores.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy, particularly noting the shift towards guessing when all options repeatedly failed. This indicates a good level of self-awareness and evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness, justifying higher scores in the good to exemplary range.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule initially but admits to abandoning it for guessing towards the end. This shows some inconsistency, hence the spread across adequate to good, with a slight possibility of being exemplary due to the honest acknowledgment of strategy shift.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses some uncertainty, especially towards the end of the task (""I just guessed at that point""). This shows a mix of confidence in the initial strategy and doubt later on, leading to a balanced spread across the middle scores."

Rationale:  
- **Comprehension**: The participant seems to have a basic understanding of the task as they mention switching ""people"" (likely meaning choices) in response to negative outcomes. However, the understanding is not deeply articulated, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of switching choices upon receiving negative feedback indicates some level of planning or hypothesis testing, but it's not elaborated upon, leading to a higher score in the ""Adequate"" range.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy beyond a simple action-reaction statement, showing a lack of deep evaluation. This is why a higher score is given to ""Absent.""
- **Final Decision**: The participant indicates a consistent rule of switching choices based on negative feedback, which is a clear decision strategy, thus a higher probability towards the higher end of the scale.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief and somewhat casual response (""No."") to whether they switched strategies suggests some uncertainty or minimal reflection on their confidence in their strategy, leading to a higher score in the ""Adequate"" range."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows some understanding of the task as they mention switching strategies based on receiving ""too many negatives."" This indicates they grasped the feedback mechanism but lacks depth in explaining the task structure or goals. Hence, a higher probability is given to scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan to switch strategies based on negative outcomes, which shows some level of hypothesis formation. However, the plan is not detailed or sophisticated, leading to a higher probability for score 2.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their strategy by indicating a reason for switching, but does not deeply analyze whether the switch was successful or why beyond the immediate negatives. This results in a higher probability for score 2.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a rule for switching strategies but does not elaborate on consistency or finality of this decision, suggesting a moderate understanding and application. Thus, scores 2 and 3 are more probable.

**Confidence:** The participant's statements show some uncertainty and lack of strong conviction in their strategy, as indicated by the simplicity and brevity of their reflection. This leads to a higher probability for scores 1 and 2."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows some understanding of the task rules by indicating a response to a negative outcome (-50). However, the reflection lacks depth in explaining the overall goal or structure of the task, suggesting a moderate level of comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of switching after a negative outcome indicates a form of hypothesis or plan about how to act. The reflection suggests a somewhat clear and thoughtful approach, hence the higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection lacks a detailed evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness. The statement does not delve into why the strategy was chosen or its results beyond avoiding repetition, indicating only a moderate level of evaluation.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states a consistent rule (""I did not try the same person twice""), which shows a decision strategy. The reflection is somewhat clear but lacks a sophisticated explanation of the strategy's basis, leading to higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and straightforward statement without questioning or doubting the approach suggests a high level of confidence in the chosen strategy. The lack of expressed doubt or uncertainty supports higher scores in this dimension."

**Comprehension:**  
The participant's reflection indicates a basic understanding of the task's goal, which was to identify patterns or ""streaks."" The mention of a specific strategy (""looked for streaks over 5"") suggests a grasp of task structure. The probabilities reflect a good understanding but not a comprehensive one, as the reflection lacks detail on whether they understood the probabilistic nature or the reversal aspect of the task.

**Judgment:**  
The participant formed a clear hypothesis or plan (""looked for streaks over 5""), indicating a deliberate approach to the task. The reflection shows a good level of judgment in forming a strategy, but it lacks depth in explaining the rationale behind choosing this specific strategy, hence the higher probabilities for scores 3 and 2.

**Evaluation:**  
The participant's reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy is minimal. They do not provide a clear assessment of whether the strategy worked or why, only stating what they did. There is some indication of evaluation, but it is not in-depth, leading to a higher probability for a score of 2.

**Final Decision:**  
The participant indicates a consistent rule or decision strategy (""always looked for streaks""), suggesting a strong adherence to their chosen approach throughout the task. This consistency is reflected in the higher probabilities for scores 4 and 3.

**Confidence:**  
The participant's confidence in their strategy is implied by the consistency of their approach and the absence of any expressed doubt. The reflection suggests a moderate to high level of confidence, as indicated by the higher probabilities for scores 4 and 3. However, the lack of explicit statements about their confidence or any reasoning behind it prevents the highest score."

There is no reflection on the effectiveness of a strategy or the reasons behind its success or failure (Evaluation), and no consistent rule or decision strategy is described (Final Decision). Finally, the participant does not express any certainty or doubt about their approach or understanding, leading to a low score in Confidence. The slight probability assigned to a score of 1 in each category acknowledges the minimal possibility that the participant understood the questions but chose not to provide a detailed response, though this is highly unlikely given the context."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows some understanding of the task's dynamics by recognizing a pattern of success over a series of turns. However, the explanation lacks depth regarding the full structure or goal of the task, suggesting a score leaning towards ""Adequate"" but not fully comprehensive.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a hypothesis about sticking with a choice until it failed, indicating some planning. The clarity and depth of this strategy suggest a score between ""Adequate"" and ""Good,"" with a slight possibility of being ""Exemplary"" due to the proactive strategy formation.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the number of turns it took to discern a pattern. This shows some evaluation but lacks a deeper analysis of why the strategy worked or didn't, fitting best between ""Adequate"" and ""Good.""
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent decision strategy (sticking with a choice until it fails), which is clear and somewhat sophisticated. This suggests a score between ""Good"" and ""Exemplary,"" with a slight chance of being just ""Adequate.""
- **Confidence**: The participant's confidence in their approach is implied but not strongly articulated. They recognized a pattern and stuck with a strategy, which shows some level of confidence, but the expression of certainty or doubt is not very strong, fitting best between ""Adequate"" and ""Good."""

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows some understanding of the task's goal, which is to stick with a choice that performs well. However, the depth of understanding the overall structure or rules isn't fully clear, hence a higher probability in the middle range (2 and 3).

**Judgment:** The participant clearly states a strategy of sticking with a choice as long as it performs well, indicating a planned approach. The clarity and thoughtfulness in expressing this strategy suggest higher scores in the 3 and 4 range.

**Evaluation:** The participant does reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly indicating that they would assess performance and react (switch when performance drops). However, there's no deep analysis of why this strategy might work or not, leading to a moderate score.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (""continue to use them until they no longer were""), which is quite clear. This suggests a higher score, leaning towards 4, but not fully exemplary as the strategy is quite basic.

**Confidence:** The participant does not express any doubt about their approach, indicating a high level of confidence in their chosen strategy. This is reflected in the higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant clearly understood the task rules and structure, as evidenced by their strategy of using a person until they failed twice. The reflection shows a good grasp of the task's requirements and goals, hence the high scores towards the upper end.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a clear hypothesis or plan (using one option until it fails twice), indicating a structured approach to decision-making. The reflection shows a thoughtful and strategic approach, justifying higher scores.

**Evaluation:** The participant did reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy by indicating a switch upon repeated failures, but the depth of this reflection is somewhat limited. They did not deeply analyze why the strategy worked or failed, hence the moderate scores.

**Final Decision:** The participant described a consistent rule or decision strategy (switching after two failures), which they applied throughout the task. This shows a clear and consistent decision-making process, warranting higher scores.

**Confidence:** The participant expressed some certainty in their approach but also indicated a degree of flexibility and adaptability by stating ""Somewhat but it was mostly the same overall strategy."" This shows a balanced level of confidence with some room for doubt, leading to a spread in the middle scores."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows an understanding of the task's structure by mentioning a systematic approach to card selection based on outcomes (losses). This indicates a grasp of the task rules and goals, but the explanation lacks depth, hence a higher probability for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant explicitly states using a systematic strategy, which reflects a clear plan or hypothesis about how to act. The clarity and intentionality behind the strategy suggest a higher score in judgment, leaning towards a good expression.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by indicating adjustments based on ""regular losses."" This shows some level of evaluation but lacks a deeper analysis of why certain strategies worked or didn't, thus a higher probability for an adequate score.

**Final Decision:** The participant asserts that their strategy was consistent throughout, indicating a clear and consistent decision-making process. This suggests a good to exemplary understanding and application of a decision strategy, hence higher scores in this dimension.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses some certainty in their approach by stating their strategy was consistent, yet the use of ""I think"" introduces a slight doubt.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant indicates a basic understanding of the task by recognizing the need to identify a pattern between choices, suggesting some grasp of the task's structure. However, the reflection lacks depth about the specific rules or goals, hence the higher probabilities for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant mentions using ""gut instinct"" and looking for patterns, which shows some form of planning or hypothesis formation. The reflection suggests a moderate level of strategic thinking, warranting a higher probability for scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant does not provide a clear reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy or reasons for its success or failure. The response is somewhat vague, leading to higher probabilities for lower scores (0, 1, and 2).

**Final Decision:** The participant's statement about sticking to a gut instinct approach throughout the task suggests a consistent decision strategy, albeit not a highly strategic one. This earns higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4, indicating a clear but not sophisticated decision rule.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and somewhat uncertain response (""No."") when asked about changing strategies, combined with reliance on ""gut instinct,"" suggests a lack of strong confidence in their approach. This is reflected in higher probabilities for lower scores (1 and 2)."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant's response suggests a basic understanding of the task's mechanics (""Change when the number is negative""), indicating some grasp of the task rules. However, the response lacks depth or explanation of the task structure or goals, suggesting a score leaning towards ""Adequate"" but not fully clear or in-depth.

**Judgment:**  
The participant's strategy (""Change when the number is negative"") implies a basic plan or hypothesis about how to act within the task. However, the simplicity and lack of elaboration suggest that while there was some judgment applied, it was not highly sophisticated or detailed.

**Evaluation:**  
The participant's response to whether they switched strategies (""No"") indicates a lack of reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy or any consideration of alternative approaches. This suggests a high probability that the evaluation dimension is largely absent.

**Final Decision:**  
The participant's adherence to a single strategy throughout the task (""No"" to switching strategies) and the mention of a specific condition for action (""Change when the number is negative"") suggest a relatively clear and consistent decision strategy, leaning towards a higher score in this dimension.

**Confidence:**  
The participant's brief and straightforward response does not explicitly convey strong confidence or doubt. The lack of elaboration or justification suggests moderate uncertainty about their approach, leading to a middle-range score in this dimension."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a clear understanding of the task's feedback mechanism (""-50"" as a signal) and the goal (scoring ""+100""). The response indicates a good grasp of the task structure, hence the higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a hypothesis about how to act (alternating choices upon receiving a ""-50""). This indicates a planned approach to the task, meriting a higher score in judgment, with a significant probability for a score of 3, reflecting clear and thoughtful planning.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting that one character seemed to score more often, indicating some evaluation of strategy success. This warrants a higher score in evaluation, with probabilities leaning towards scores 3 and 4, showing thoughtful reflection.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent decision strategy (alternating choices based on specific feedback) and identifies a potentially more successful character. This shows a clear decision-making process, justifying higher scores in this dimension.

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt but implies some level of certainty by sticking to a strategy and noting observations about character performance. The distribution reflects moderate confidence, with a higher probability for score 3, indicating clear but not overly confident expression."

**Rationale:**
- **Comprehension:** The participant's statement suggests a minimal understanding of the task as they claim not to use any strategy. This indicates some level of understanding (they know they were expected to have a strategy), but it's not clear if they understood the task's goals or rules deeply. Hence, a higher probability is given to a score of 1.
- **Judgment:** The participant explicitly states they did not use any strategy, indicating an absence of forming any hypothesis or plan about how to act. This is almost a clear absence, thus the high probability for a score of 0.
- **Evaluation:** Similar to judgment, the participant's lack of strategy use implies they did not reflect on the effectiveness of a strategy or its outcomes, leading to a high probability of scoring 0.
- **Final Decision:** The participant's repeated statement about not using a strategy suggests they consistently applied this non-strategy. This is somewhat paradoxical but indicates a rudimentary decision strategy (to not have one), hence a higher score for 1.
- **Confidence:** The participant's repeated and straightforward assertion (""I did not use any particular strategy. ; I did not."") displays a high level of confidence about their approach, even though it was to not have a strategy. This clarity and certainty in their response justify a high probability for a score of 4."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's goal (to hit the option that gives 100 points). However, the explanation lacks depth about the overall structure or rules beyond the immediate reward, suggesting a score leaning towards ""Adequate"" but not fully comprehensive.

**Judgment:** The participant describes a strategy of selecting the option that gives the highest reward and mentions switching occasionally. This indicates some level of planning and hypothesis testing, meriting a score between ""Adequate"" and ""Good.""

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by returning to the option that gives 100 points after trying others. This shows some evaluation but lacks depth on why this strategy worked or didn't, suggesting a score leaning towards ""Adequate.""

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a somewhat consistent decision strategy of returning to the high-reward option. This indicates a clear but not fully sophisticated strategy application, fitting a score between ""Adequate"" and ""Good.""

**Confidence:** The participant's brief statement implies some level of certainty in their approach by returning to the high-reward option, but the lack of explicit confidence or doubt expressions suggests a score around ""Adequate."""

- **Judgment**: The participant outlines a specific strategy based on the outcomes (-50) they experienced, indicating a planned approach to the task. The clarity and detail in their strategy formulation suggest a judgment leaning towards good.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by indicating a shift when outcomes were consistently negative.

The participant's reflection, ""None. ; No strategy."" provides minimal information across all dimensions of the Metacognitive Prompting framework. 

- **Comprehension:** The response suggests a lack of engagement or understanding of the task, as the participant states they used no strategy. This indicates a probable absence of comprehension of the task's rules or goals.
- **Judgment:** The participant indicates no formation of a hypothesis or plan, as they explicitly state they used no strategy.
- **Evaluation:** There is no reflection on the effectiveness of a strategy or reasons for its success or failure, as no strategy was claimed to be used.
- **Final Decision:** The participant does not describe any consistent rule or decision strategy, reinforcing the notion of no strategy usage.
- **Confidence:** The brief and dismissive nature of the response suggests a lack of engagement rather than a reflection of confidence or doubt about their approach.

Given the extremely brief and negative nature of the reflection, high probabilities are assigned to a score of 0 across all dimensions, indicating an absence of metacognitive elements as per the scoring rubric."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's brief statement suggests a basic understanding of the task as they mention sticking with the same choices frequently. However, the depth of understanding the task rules, structure, or goal is not clearly articulated, leading to a higher probability for a score of 2 (Adequate).

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of staying with the same choices implies some form of plan or hypothesis, but it is not elaborated upon. This warrants a higher probability for a score of 1 (Rudimentary) and 2 (Adequate), as there is minimal evidence of a well-formed hypothesis.

**Evaluation:** The participant does not reflect on whether their strategy was effective or why it might have been so. This dimension is almost absent, justifying a high probability for a score of 0 (Absent).

**Final Decision:** The participant indicates a consistent rule or decision strategy by sticking with the same choices, though the reasoning behind this decision is not explained. This suggests a higher probability for a score of 3 (Good), as they describe a consistent strategy.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their approach or understanding is not explicitly mentioned. The brief response and lack of depth in explaining their confidence or doubt about their strategy suggest a higher probability for a score of 2 (Adequate)."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by describing their actions in response to the outcomes (players failing). They recognize the structure of making choices based on outcomes, indicating some comprehension, but the depth of understanding the overall goal or rules isn't fully articulated, hence a higher probability for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant describes a clear plan of action (switching players after failures), which shows they formed a hypothesis about how to act. The strategy, although described as ""no real strategy,"" still reflects a systematic approach to decision-making, justifying higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly suggesting it was based on the performance of the players, indicating some evaluation. They do not deeply analyze why this strategy was chosen or its effectiveness beyond immediate outcomes, supporting a higher score in the middle range.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule they applied (giving a player one more chance after a failure). This shows a clear decision strategy, although it's not sophisticated in terms of strategic depth or adaptation. The probabilities favor higher scores due to the clarity of the rule described.

**Confidence:** The participant does not express strong confidence or doubt explicitly; however, the casual mention of their strategy and its application suggests a moderate level of certainty about their approach. They do not question or critically analyze their confidence level, leading to a balanced distribution with a slight lean towards higher scores."

**Rationale:**
- **Comprehension:** The participant's reflection shows minimal understanding of the task as they mention ""taking a guess"" and noticing ""some kind of a pattern."" This suggests a rudimentary grasp of the task's probabilistic nature but lacks depth or clarity about the specific rules or goals, hence a higher probability for a score of 1.
- **Judgment:** The participant's strategy initially was to guess, indicating a lack of a formulated plan or hypothesis at the beginning. However, the mention of noticing a pattern suggests some development of judgment over time, leading to a higher score in the adequate range.
- **Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by acknowledging the recognition of a pattern, which implies some evaluation of their initial approach. This warrants a split between adequate and good, as there is some reflection but not a deep analysis of why their strategy worked or didn't.
- **Final Decision:** The participant indicates a shift in strategy upon noticing a pattern, which suggests a decision to adapt based on their observations. However, the lack of detail about the nature of this final decision strategy leads to a higher score in the adequate range.
- **Confidence:** The participant's language (""Nothing particular,"" ""taking a guess"") expresses a significant level of uncertainty about their approach and understanding of the task, suggesting a higher probability for a rudimentary score in confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows some understanding of the task's structure by recognizing the negative feedback (-50) and responding to it. The response indicates a basic grasp but lacks depth in explaining the overall goal or rules beyond reacting to negative feedback. Hence, a higher probability is given to scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan based on the feedback received (switching strategies after consecutive negative outcomes). This shows a clear, albeit simple, hypothesis about how to act, meriting a higher score in the judgment dimension, particularly leaning towards scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly suggesting that a change was necessary after repeated negative feedback. This indicates some level of evaluation, but the depth of this reflection is not fully developed. Thus, scores 3 and 2 are more probable.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (switching after two negative outcomes). This strategy is clear and specific, suggesting a higher score in this dimension, with a lean towards scores 4 and 3.

**Confidence:** The participant's response does not explicitly express confidence or doubt, but the straightforward nature of the strategy (""If I got -50 twice in a row I tried a new student"") and the lack of questioning or uncertainty in the statement suggest a higher level of confidence, thus higher scores in this dimension."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant shows some understanding of the task as they attempted to use strategies like counting 'yes' cards and finding patterns. However, the reflection lacks depth about the task's rules or goals, suggesting a moderate level of comprehension.

**Judgment:**  
The participant formed initial strategies (counting and pattern recognition), indicating some judgment. The reflection suggests a shift in strategies, though not deeply reasoned or sophisticated, hence a higher probability for a moderate score.

**Evaluation:**  
The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategies by noting the short duration of their application, indicating some level of evaluation. However, there is no deep analysis of why these strategies were ineffective, leading to a higher probability for an average score.

**Final Decision:**  
The reflection shows some inconsistency in strategy application without settling on a final, effective method. This suggests a moderate understanding and application of a decision strategy, with some room for improvement.

**Confidence:**  
The participant's language (""not particularly,"" ""didn't last long"") expresses doubt and uncertainty about their approach and understanding of the task. This indicates a higher probability for lower scores in confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows some understanding of the task as they mention switching strategies when losing points, indicating they grasped the task's feedback mechanism. However, the reflection lacks depth about the task's structure or goals, hence the higher probabilities for lower scores.

**Judgment:** The participant hints at a decision-making process (""If I lost points too much I switched""), suggesting some form of planning or hypothesis. However, the statement is brief and lacks detail, leading to a higher probability for a rudimentary score.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects minimally on their strategy's effectiveness (""I'm not sure""), showing some level of evaluation but with significant uncertainty and lack of depth. This warrants a higher score in the lower range.

**Final Decision:** The participant's statement about strategy switching is vague and shows uncertainty (""I'm not sure. I don't think so.""), indicating a lack of a clear, consistent decision strategy. This results in higher probabilities for lower scores.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses doubt and uncertainty about their approach, which is evident in their statements. This lack of confidence leads to higher probabilities for lower scores in this dimension."

- **Comprehension**: The participant shows a clear understanding of the task rules by describing their response to consecutive losses, indicating a strategy based on the task's structure. The response suggests a good grasp but lacks a detailed explanation of the task's goal or deeper insights into the task structure, hence the distribution leaning towards a score of 3.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a clear plan (switching choices after consecutive losses), which shows a strategic approach to the task. The plan is somewhat detailed but not deeply sophisticated, which justifies a higher probability for a score of 3.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by describing what they did after a switch resulted in a loss, indicating some level of strategy evaluation. However, there is no deep analysis of why certain strategies worked or didn't, supporting a higher score in the middle range.
- **Final Decision**: The participant indicates a consistent application of their strategy throughout the task, suggesting a clear final decision on the strategy used. The reflection lacks a detailed justification for sticking with the strategy, which supports a higher score towards 4 but not fully exemplary.
- **Confidence**: The participant's statement about sticking to the same strategy throughout the task suggests confidence in their approach.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's reflection indicates a basic understanding of the task as involving choices, but there is a lack of depth in understanding the rules or goals beyond recognizing randomness. The participant does not articulate a clear grasp of the task structure, hence the higher probabilities for lower scores.

**Judgment:** The participant mentions a strategy of selecting ""who I felt was the plus 100,"" which shows some form of hypothesis or plan, albeit a simplistic one based on intuition rather than a reasoned strategy. This warrants a higher probability for a score of 1 or 2, indicating rudimentary to adequate judgment.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the randomness of the task and their response to it, suggesting some level of evaluation. However, the reflection lacks depth in analyzing why their strategy might or might not have worked, leading to a balanced distribution across lower to middle scores.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent approach (""just pick who I felt was the plus 100""), indicating some level of decision-making. However, the strategy is not based on a sophisticated understanding or adaptation, which justifies a higher probability for an adequate score.

The probability is skewed towards a score of 1, indicating minimal expression.
- **Judgment**: The participant hints at a strategy (""find the person that would benefit me more""), suggesting some form of hypothesis or plan. However, the lack of detail or depth in the strategy description leads to a higher probability for a score of 2, with some possibility of a score of 3 if interpreted as a clear but simple plan.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's response to whether they switched strategies (""No"") does not reflect on the effectiveness or reasons behind their strategy's success or failure. This dimension is almost entirely absent, leading to a high probability for a score of 0.
- **Final Decision**: The participant's firm ""No"" in response to changing strategies suggests a strong adherence to their initial decision-making approach. This indicates a consistent rule or decision strategy, meriting a high probability for a score of 4.

- **Comprehension**: The participant's brief mention of ""trial and error"" suggests some understanding of the task's trial-based nature, but lacks depth regarding the rules or goals. The probability leans towards a score of 2 (Adequate) as there is some understanding but it's not detailed.
- **Judgment**: The participant indicates a strategy (""trial and error"") and a condition for strategy change (""only when the partner... started giving frequently -50 results""), showing some planning and hypothesis formation. The probabilities are distributed with a lean towards 1 (Rudimentary) and 2 (Adequate) as the strategy is mentioned but not elaborated.
- **Evaluation**: The reflection includes a minimal evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness linked to the outcome (-50 results), but lacks depth in analyzing why the strategy worked or didn't.

- **Final Decision**: The participant mentions a decision to switch strategies under certain conditions, which shows some rule application. However, the description is not consistent or detailed, leading to a higher probability for 2 (Adequate) and some for 1 (Rudimentary).
- **Confidence**: The participant's expression does not strongly convey certainty or doubt about their approach, leading to a distribution with higher probabilities in 1 (Rudimentary) and 2 (Adequate).

- **Comprehension**: The participant seems to understand the basic idea of sticking with a choice until it fails, indicating some grasp of the task's rules or structure. However, the depth of understanding isn't fully clear, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of sticking with a successful option until failure suggests a clear plan or hypothesis was formed, leaning towards a ""Good"" score due to the simplicity yet effectiveness of such a strategy.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's reflection lacks a detailed evaluation of why their strategy worked or didn't work, only indicating a basic reflection on the strategy's outcome without deeper analysis. This suggests a score leaning towards ""Adequate.""
- **Final Decision**: The participant clearly states a consistent rule they applied throughout the task, which is to stick with a successful option until it fails. This strategy is straightforward and shows a higher level of decision-making clarity, hence a higher score towards ""Exemplary.""
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief and somewhat ambiguous reflection (""No"" at the end) suggests some uncertainty or minimal confidence in their approach or understanding, leading to a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows some understanding of the task rules by indicating a response to negative outcomes (-50). The mention of ""different deck"" suggests they grasped the concept of multiple options and the need to switch under certain conditions. The probabilities reflect a good but not exemplary understanding.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of switching decks after two negative outcomes indicates a planned approach to the task, suggesting a good level of judgment. The higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4 reflect this clear, though not highly sophisticated, planning.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's brief reflection on their strategy (""after two -50 I would look into a different deck"") implies some level of evaluation of their actions, though it lacks depth about why this strategy might be effective beyond the immediate response to loss. Thus, a higher score in the middle range is justified.
- **Final Decision**: The participant indicates a consistent rule (""after two -50 I would look into a different deck""), showing a clear decision strategy. The response is straightforward and shows a rational approach, meriting a higher score towards the upper end.
- **Confidence**: The participant does not explicitly express confidence, but the decisiveness in their strategy suggests a level of certainty. The absence of doubt or alternative considerations leads to higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows some understanding of the task's structure by recognizing the reward patterns and responding to them. The response indicates a basic grasp but lacks depth in explaining the task rules or goals comprehensively.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a basic plan to stick with one option until it became consistently low rewarding. This shows a clear strategy, though not highly sophisticated or detailed.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the change in reward consistency, which suggests some evaluation. However, the depth of this reflection is not fully developed.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule they applied (sticking with one option until it was no longer rewarding), indicating a clear decision strategy. The response suggests a moderate to high level of strategic consistency.
- **Confidence**: The participant's confidence is somewhat ambiguous. The brief and straightforward response shows some level of certainty in their strategy, but the lack of elaboration or strong assertive language suggests only moderate confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant shows an understanding of the task's basic mechanics (choosing the option that provides the highest reward) but does not elaborate on the structure or deeper rules of the task. The response indicates a basic grasp, hence the split between scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:**  
The participant formed a simple plan: continue selecting the option that previously gave the highest reward. This shows some level of strategic planning, though not sophisticated. The higher probability towards a score of 3 reflects this basic but clear strategy.

**Evaluation:**  
The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly indicating that they persisted with it until the conditions changed (reward value decreased). This shows a good level of self-assessment, meriting a high score in evaluation.

**Final Decision:**  
The strategy described is consistent and clear: keep choosing the ""100 dudes"" until they no longer give 100. This is a definitive and unwavering strategy, deserving a full score.

**Confidence:**  
The participant's brief response exudes confidence in their chosen approach, with no expression of doubt or uncertainty about its effectiveness. The simplicity and assertiveness in the statement justify a high score in confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by indicating a response to negative outcomes and a decision to ignore a specific option after the first round. The reflection suggests a moderate understanding but lacks depth in explaining the structure or goal beyond immediate reactions, hence the higher probabilities for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy to switch upon encountering negatives indicates some level of planning or hypothesis formation about how to act. The reflection, however, does not elaborate on the reasoning behind the strategy, leading to a higher score in the middle range, with a lean towards a good understanding.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by indicating a switch after a streak of negatives, suggesting some evaluation. However, the depth of this evaluation is not fully clear, as there is no detailed analysis of why the strategy worked or didn't, thus the higher probabilities for scores 2 and 3.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's mechanics (clicking until a change occurs), but the reflection lacks depth on the overall goal or rules beyond this mechanic. The probabilities reflect a stronger leaning towards ""Adequate"" and ""Good"" comprehension, with a slight possibility of ""Exemplary"" due to understanding the change trigger.

**Judgment:** The participant describes a clear strategy of sticking with one choice until a negative outcome, indicating some planning and hypothesis formation. The probabilities favor ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"" as the participant not only formed a plan but also adapted it based on outcomes.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their strategy by indicating a shift upon a negative outcome, but does not deeply analyze why this might be effective or not. The probabilities are distributed more towards ""Adequate"" and ""Good,"" with some room for ""Rudimentary"" due to the lack of depth in reflection.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule they applied (sticking with one choice until it fails), which shows a clear decision strategy. The probabilities are skewed towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"" as the strategy is clearly articulated.

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt, but the clarity in describing their strategy suggests some level of confidence. The probabilities are therefore leaning more towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary,"" with a small chance of ""Adequate"" due to the lack of explicit confidence expression."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's feedback mechanism (negative scores) and uses this to guide decisions. The strategy of switching after a certain number of negatives or specific score patterns indicates an understanding of the task's probabilistic nature, though not deeply elaborated. Hence, a higher probability is given to scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant clearly formed a plan based on the feedback (negative scores and score patterns). The strategy is articulated with specific conditions for switching, showing a good level of planning and hypothesis formation. This warrants higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by monitoring outcomes (number of negatives) and adjusting based on these observations. This shows some level of strategy evaluation, meriting a higher score in the 3 range, with some possibility for a 4.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule for decision-making based on the observed outcomes, which indicates a clear final decision strategy. The strategy, while not complex, is consistently applied, justifying higher scores in the 3 and 4 range.

**Confidence:** The participant's expression shows some uncertainty and lack of depth in their confidence about the strategy, as indicated by the simplistic nature of the strategy and the brief explanation. This suggests moderate confidence, leaning more towards doubt, hence a higher probability for score 2."

**Rationale:**
- **Comprehension:** The participant's response indicates a high level of understanding of the task's probabilistic nature by acknowledging the reliance on ""luck,"" which suggests a sophisticated insight into the randomness inherent in the task. This is why the probability is skewed towards a higher score.
- **Judgment:** The participant explicitly states they did not use a ""real strategy,"" indicating a lack of deliberate planning or hypothesis formation about how to approach the task. This is reflected in the high probability for a lower score.
- **Evaluation:** Similar to judgment, the participant does not reflect on the effectiveness of their approach (since they claim to not have used a strategy), leading to a high probability of a lower score.
- **Final Decision:** The participant's consistent adherence to not using a strategy and relying on luck throughout the task shows a clear, albeit unconventional, decision strategy. This is recognized with a higher score.
- **Confidence:** The participant's use of a casual tone (""just luck. ; No"") and the clear, albeit brief, statement of their approach suggests a high level of confidence in their understanding and approach, despite its simplicity. This is why the score is skewed towards a higher rating."

- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy formulation is evident as they describe a clear if-then conditional approach (""stayed with someone as long as it was going well, and left after one or more negative outcomes""). This reflects a planned approach to decision-making, meriting a score between 2 and 4.
- **Evaluation**: The participant implicitly evaluates their strategy by indicating the conditions under which they would switch choices, suggesting some level of reflection on the strategy's effectiveness. This warrants a score between 2 and 4.
- **Final Decision**: The participant clearly articulates a consistent rule or decision strategy (""stayed with someone as long as it was going well, and left after one or more negative outcomes""), which is a direct and clear statement of their final decision-making process. This suggests a higher score, likely between 3 and 4.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task as they recognized the variability in outcomes (""half good and half bad""). However, there is no clear indication that they fully grasped the rules or goals beyond trying all options. Hence, a higher probability is given to a score of 2 (Adequate).

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy (""just tried all colors"") suggests a rudimentary plan without much sophistication or adaptation. The reflection lacks depth in strategic planning, leading to a higher probability for a score of 1 (Rudimentary).

**Evaluation:** The participant does reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the mixed results, but there is no deeper analysis or reasoning about why this was the case. This warrants a higher probability for a score of 1 (Rudimentary).

**Final Decision:** The participant does not describe a consistent rule or decision strategy they ultimately applied, as they mention not switching strategies and only trying all options. This suggests some level of decision-making but not a refined or consistent strategy, leading to a higher probability for a score of 2 (Adequate).

**Confidence:** The participant's expression shows some uncertainty and lack of commitment to their approach (""no""), indicating they were not confident about their strategy. This suggests a higher probability for a score of 2 (Adequate), reflecting some doubt but not complete uncertainty."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response indicates a basic understanding of the task's feedback mechanism (responding to negative feedback), but lacks a clear articulation of the overall task structure or goals. The response suggests some understanding but not a comprehensive grasp, hence a higher probability for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant mentions a decision-making criterion (switching strategies based on feedback), which shows some level of planning or hypothesis formation. However, the explanation is not detailed, leading to a higher probability for scores 1 and 2.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy is implied but not explicitly discussed. They mention switching strategies based on feedback, which suggests some evaluation, but without depth or reasoning about why this approach was chosen or its effectiveness, leading to higher probabilities for scores 1 and 2.

**Final Decision:** The participant indicates a decision rule (switching on negative feedback), but the strategy is not elaborated upon or justified with deeper reasoning. This suggests an adequate level of decision-making clarity but not a sophisticated or fully consistent strategy, hence a higher probability for score 2.

**Confidence:** The participant does not express clear confidence or doubt about their strategy; the response is somewhat ambiguous and lacks depth in expressing certainty about the approach. This ambiguity leads to higher probabilities for lower scores, with a peak at score 1."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's goal, which was to find the most consistent option. However, the depth of understanding regarding the task structure or rules isn't fully articulated, hence a higher probability in the middle range (2 and 3).

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan to find the most consistent option and stuck with it, indicating some level of strategic planning. The clarity and depth of this plan are somewhat evident, leading to a higher score in the 'Good' range.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects minimally on the effectiveness of their strategy by mentioning consistency but does not delve into why this strategy worked or didn't work beyond a superficial level. This warrants a higher score in the 'Adequate' range.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states that they did not switch strategies and chose to stick with what seemed most consistent. This shows a clear decision-making process, leaning towards a higher score in the 'Good' to 'Exemplary' range.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses a level of certainty in their approach by sticking to one strategy throughout the task. However, there isn't a strong expression of confidence or self-doubt, which places the score predominantly in the 'Good' range."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task rules by describing a strategy of sticking with one option until it fails. The response indicates an understanding of the task's probabilistic nature and the need for strategy adjustment, hence the higher probabilities towards the upper end of the scale.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy formulation (""held on the same image until it had a negative point, then I switched"") reflects a clear plan of action, suggesting a good level of judgment. The response, however, lacks depth in explaining the rationale behind the choice, which prevents the highest score.

**Evaluation:** The participant does not provide a detailed reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy beyond a simple action-reaction sequence. There is minimal insight into why they believe their strategy worked or didn't, hence the moderate probabilities in the middle of the scale.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (""held on the same image until it had a negative point, then I switched""), which they applied throughout the task. This shows a clear final decision strategy, meriting a higher score, but the lack of nuanced explanation or adaptation prevents a full score.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and straightforward response suggests a level of confidence in their strategy, as they did not express any doubt or uncertainty about their approach. The lack of questioning or exploring alternatives further supports a higher confidence score."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant understood the task rules to some extent, as indicated by their strategy of sticking with an option until it failed multiple times. This shows a basic grasp of the task's probabilistic nature and the need for reversal. The probabilities reflect a good understanding but not a sophisticated insight into the task's deeper mechanics or goals.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan (sticking with an option until it failed repeatedly), which shows some judgment. The higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4 reflect that the participant had a clear plan, though it was not highly sophisticated or varied.

**Evaluation:** The participant did reflect minimally on their strategy's effectiveness, as they mentioned switching after repeated failures. However, the reflection lacks depth on why this strategy was chosen or its effectiveness beyond the immediate results. The distribution leans towards an adequate score, acknowledging some evaluation but not a thorough analysis.

**Final Decision:** The participant described a consistent rule they applied (sticking with an option until it failed multiple times), which shows a clear decision strategy. The higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4 reflect this clarity and consistency in their approach.

**Confidence:** The participant did not express explicit confidence or doubt about their strategy, but the simplicity and adherence to their rule suggest a level of implicit confidence. The higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4 reflect this inferred confidence from their consistent application of the strategy without questioning or modifying it significantly."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task by recognizing the reward system (e.g., ""the first one to give me 100""). However, the explanation lacks depth about the overall structure or goal beyond immediate rewards, suggesting a score leaning towards ""Adequate"" but with some room for ""Good.""

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan (""go through all of them and the first one to give me 100 I tried to stay with""), indicating some strategy formulation. The clarity and simplicity of the plan suggest a score between ""Adequate"" and ""Good,"" with a slight possibility of ""Exemplary"" due to the straightforwardness and effectiveness of the approach.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the strategy's effectiveness, particularly noting an exception (""besides 1 round where I got mostly -50""). This shows some evaluation of the strategy's performance, warranting a score between ""Adequate"" and ""Good,"" with some potential for ""Exemplary"" due to the acknowledgment of specific outcomes affecting their strategy.

**Final Decision:** The participant indicates a consistent rule or decision strategy (""I tried to stay with"") but also notes a deviation in one instance. This suggests a score between ""Adequate"" and ""Exemplary,"" leaning more towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"" because they describe sticking to a decision rule despite a noted exception.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their strategy is implied but not strongly articulated. They do not express strong doubt or certainty, suggesting a score between ""Adequate"" and ""Good,"" with some probability for ""Rudimentary"" due to the lack of explicit confidence expression."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant's statement ""I tried to click the one I saw winning more often"" suggests a basic understanding of the task's goal, which is to select the option that appears most successful. This indicates some comprehension, but the lack of detail about the task structure or deeper understanding of the rules limits the score to mostly Adequate (2).
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of selecting the option observed as most successful implies a basic plan or hypothesis was formed. The clarity of this strategy is somewhat evident, leading to a score leaning towards Good (3), with some probability for Adequate (2) due to lack of depth in strategic planning.
- **Evaluation**: The participant did not reflect on whether their strategy was effective or why it might have worked or failed, as indicated by the terse response and the absence of any evaluative comments. This dimension scores predominantly as Absent (0).
- **Final Decision**: The participant seems to have stuck with their initial strategy throughout, as indicated by the lack of mention of any strategy change and the brief confirmation ""; no"" to not switching strategies. This suggests a consistent rule was applied, scoring mostly as Good (3) due to the clarity of sticking to a single decision strategy.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief and somewhat casual response, especially the use of a semicolon and ""no"" without further explanation, suggests a lack of expressed certainty or reflection on their understanding of the task. This dimension is scored predominantly as Absent (0) with some probability for Rudimentary (1) due to minimal expression of confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response indicates a basic understanding of the task as they were aware of the need to switch between choices. However, the depth of understanding regarding the structure or goal of the task is not clear. The response suggests some comprehension but lacks depth, hence a higher probability for a score of 2 or 3.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of ""Just switching between the choices"" implies a rudimentary plan or hypothesis about how to act, but it lacks sophistication or a clear rationale. This suggests a higher probability for a score of 2, with some possibility of lower scores due to the minimalistic nature of the strategy.

**Evaluation:** The participant did not reflect on whether their strategy worked or why, which suggests a high probability for a score of 0. There is a slight chance for a score of 1, considering they might have implicitly evaluated their strategy by continuing to use it.

**Final Decision:** The participant described a consistent rule or decision strategy (""Just switching between the choices""), but it is very basic and lacks sophistication. This suggests a higher probability for a score of 2, with some chance for a score of 1 due to the simplicity of the strategy.

**Confidence:** The participant did not express any explicit confidence or doubt about their approach. The response lacks any strong indicators of self-assurance or uncertainty, leading to a balanced distribution across lower scores, with a slight lean towards a score of 2 due to the neutral nature of the statement."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant seems to have a basic understanding of the task's mechanics, as indicated by their description of how rewards typically return to a previously rewarding choice. The response suggests a moderate level of understanding but lacks depth in explaining the overall goal or structure beyond immediate outcomes. Hence, a higher probability is assigned to scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:** The participant outlines a specific strategy based on observed patterns of reward, which shows some planning and hypothesis formation. However, the explanation is not very detailed, leading to a higher score in the middle range (2 and 3), with some probability of a higher score due to the clear mention of a strategy.

**Evaluation:** The participant does not provide a detailed reflection on the effectiveness of their strategy beyond a simple statement of adherence to it, indicating some level of evaluation but not a deep or thorough analysis. This results in a higher probability for a score of 2, with some chance of lower or slightly higher scores.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states that they did not switch strategies, which indicates a consistent application of their chosen method. This decision is articulated with some certainty, justifying higher scores in the range of 3 and 4, with a slight possibility of a lower score due to the lack of detailed justification.

**Confidence:** The participant's assertion of sticking with a single strategy throughout the task and the absence of expressed doubt about this approach suggest a higher level of confidence. This is reflected in the higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4, with a small chance of a lower score due to the brevity of the explanation."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows an understanding of the task's goal to avoid negative outcomes, indicating some comprehension but not a deep understanding of the task's structure or rules. The response is somewhat clear but lacks depth, hence a higher probability for a score of 2.
- **Judgment**: The participant mentions a strategy of switching partners often after negative outcomes, which shows some planning and hypothesis formation. The clarity and thoughtfulness in expressing this strategy suggest a higher score towards 3.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not deeply reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy beyond the immediate reaction to negative outcomes. There is minimal evaluation of whether the strategy was successful overall, leading to a higher probability for scores 1 and 2.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule of switching partners after negative outcomes, which is somewhat clear and shows a decision strategy. The response leans towards a good understanding and application of a decision rule, hence a higher score towards 3.
- **Confidence**: The participant does not express strong certainty or doubt about their approach; the language used (""if we call it that"") suggests some uncertainty. This leads to a higher probability for lower scores in this dimension."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's statement ""I tried figuring out a pattern"" suggests some understanding of the task's requirement to identify patterns or rules. However, the lack of detail about the task structure or goals limits the score. The probabilities reflect a moderate understanding with some uncertainty about the depth of comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant's attempt to find a pattern indicates a basic hypothesis or plan. The lack of elaboration on how they tried to figure out the pattern or any strategic adjustments suggests a somewhat rudimentary approach to forming a judgment. The probabilities lean towards an adequate score, acknowledging the attempt but recognizing the lack of depth.

**Evaluation:** The participant acknowledges that their strategy of finding a pattern ""didn't really work,"" which shows some reflection on the effectiveness of their approach. The probabilities favor a good score, as there is clear evidence of evaluation, but the brevity and lack of detailed analysis prevent a higher score.

**Final Decision:** The participant's brief response does not clearly describe a consistent rule or decision strategy they ultimately applied, other than attempting to find a pattern. The probabilities are distributed with a slight emphasis on an adequate score, reflecting the minimal information provided about their final strategy.

**Confidence:** The participant's expression ""didn't really work"" and the very brief response indicate some doubt about their approach and understanding of the task. The probabilities are skewed towards lower scores, reflecting this uncertainty and lack of confidence in their strategy."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's mechanics, as they recognized the need to switch strategies based on the success of their choices. The response indicates a grasp of the task's rules and goals, though not in great detail, hence the higher probabilities towards the middle and upper end of the scale.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a plan to stick with a successful choice until it became unsuccessful, indicating some level of strategic planning. The response suggests a moderate level of judgment used in deciding when to switch strategies, reflected in the higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflected on the effectiveness of their strategy by monitoring the success of their choices and adjusting accordingly. This shows a good level of evaluation, as they not only noticed the drop in points but acted on it, justifying the higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Final Decision:** The participant described a consistent rule or decision strategy by sticking with a choice until it failed and then searching for another successful option. This clear articulation of a strategy supports a higher score in this dimension, with a strong lean towards scores 3 and 4.

**Confidence:** The participant did not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their strategy, but the mere act of sticking with a strategy until it proved unsuccessful and then finding a new one suggests a certain level of confidence in their approach. The probabilities are balanced towards the middle and upper end, reflecting this implicit confidence."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant seems to have a basic understanding of the task as they describe sticking with a partner until repeated negative outcomes. This suggests some grasp of the task's structure involving repeated interactions and assessments. The response is not very detailed, hence a higher probability in the middle range.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of not reacting to a single negative outcome and waiting for repeated negatives shows a planned approach, indicating some judgment in their strategy. The clarity and thoughtfulness in describing this approach suggest a higher score in the upper range.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on their strategy by indicating a threshold of tolerance for bad grades before switching, which shows some evaluation. However, the depth of this reflection is not fully explored, warranting a higher score in the middle range.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states a consistent rule (""stuck with a partner until they had repeatedly given me a bad grade""), which shows a final decision strategy. The clarity and consistency in this strategy suggest a higher score towards the upper end.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a clear understanding of the task rules and structure, as evidenced by their strategy of switching partners based on the receipt of negative points. The response indicates a grasp of the goal (maximizing positive points), but lacks a detailed explanation of the task structure, hence the spread leaning towards higher scores but not fully exemplary.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a clear plan: continue with a partner until receiving two negative points, then switch. This demonstrates a hypothesis about how to act, which is articulated but not deeply sophisticated or nuanced, hence a higher probability for a score of 3.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by indicating that they switched when the strategy of sticking with one partner did not work (negative points received). This shows some level of evaluation but lacks depth in analyzing why this strategy worked or didn't, thus a higher score in the middle range.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule-based strategy they applied throughout the task. The clarity in their final decision-making process is evident, though the strategy itself is simple and not highly sophisticated, leading to a higher score but not the highest.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses a clear and straightforward confidence in their strategy by stating they did not switch strategies and kept with the same approach throughout. This shows a strong level of confidence, though it lacks a deeper reflection on possible doubts or uncertainties, which would have been necessary for a perfect score."

The reflection shows a good grasp of the task rules and goals, hence the higher probabilities towards the upper end of the scale.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a clear hypothesis about how to act, which was to follow a pattern and switch based on the outcome (100 points or negative points). This indicates a well-thought-out plan, meriting a higher score in judgment.

**Evaluation:** The participant did reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the outcomes (100 points vs. negative points) and adjusting accordingly. This shows some level of strategy evaluation, warranting a moderate to high score.

**Final Decision:** The participant described a consistent rule or decision strategy they applied throughout the game, which was to stick to a pattern unless it failed, and then to switch. This clear articulation of a consistent strategy justifies a high score in this dimension.

- **Judgment**: The participant describes forming a plan based on the outcomes they experienced (giving a second chance after a loss of points). This indicates a transition from an initial strategy to a more refined approach as they gained experience, suggesting good judgment.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by adjusting it based on the outcomes (-50 points). This shows some evaluation but lacks a deeper analysis of why this strategy might be effective or not, placing it between adequate and good.
- **Final Decision**: The reflection indicates a clear decision rule in the later stages of the task (adjusting strategy after a specific point loss), which shows a good final decision-making process, leaning towards exemplary as they solidified their approach.

- **Comprehension**: The participant's statement suggests a basic understanding of the task (finding the best partner), but lacks depth in understanding the rules or structure, hence a high probability for an ""Adequate"" score.
- **Judgment**: The participant mentions a method (""randomly selecting""), indicating some form of plan, albeit a simplistic one. This warrants a higher probability for a ""Rudimentary"" score.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not reflect on the effectiveness or reasons behind their strategy working or not, leading to a high probability for an ""Absent"" score.
- **Final Decision**: The participant's mention of a consistent approach (""randomly selecting"") throughout the task suggests some decision strategy, leaning towards a ""Good"" score.
- **Confidence**: The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their approach, but the use of a definitive statement (""Just tried to find the Best partner"") suggests some level of confidence, thus a higher score in this dimension."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows an understanding of the task's basic mechanics, as they recognize the need to avoid decks that consistently give negative points. However, the reflection lacks depth in explaining the overall goal or structure beyond this point, suggesting a moderate level of comprehension.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of switching decks after consistent negative outcomes indicates some level of planning and hypothesis formation. The reflection suggests a somewhat systematic approach, hence the higher probabilities for scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by implicitly evaluating the outcome (switching decks when facing negative points). This shows some level of self-assessment, but it lacks a detailed analysis of why this strategy was chosen or its effectiveness across different scenarios.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule they applied (switching after three negative turns), which shows a clear decision strategy. The reflection supports a higher score as it indicates a thoughtful and somewhat effective approach to the task.

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their strategy is not explicitly stated, and the reflection ends with a contradictory statement (""I did not.""), which introduces uncertainty about their confidence in the strategy used. This ambiguity suggests a lower score in confidence, with moderate probabilities distributed across the middle of the scale."

- **Comprehension**: The participant's response ""No particular strategy ; no"" suggests a minimal understanding of the task's rules, structure, or goal. The lack of detail implies rudimentary comprehension, hence a high probability for a score of 1.
- **Judgment**: The response indicates an absence of any formulated hypothesis or plan, as the participant explicitly states ""No particular strategy."" This suggests a high probability for a score of 0.
- **Evaluation**: Similarly, the lack of any reflection on whether a strategy worked or why it might not have worked leads to a high probability for a score of 0.
- **Final Decision**: The participant's brief response does not describe any consistent rule or decision strategy, suggesting a high probability for a score of 1, indicating only a rudimentary expression of a final decision.
- **Confidence**: The participant's terse response does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their approach or understanding. The use of a definitive ""no"" might suggest some level of certainty, albeit minimal, about not using a strategy, leading to a higher probability for a score of 2."

Rationale:  
- **Comprehension**: The participant clearly understood the task rules and the goal, as indicated by their strategy of sticking with one card until it changed. The reflection shows a good grasp of the task's probabilistic nature, hence the high scores towards 4.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a hypothesis about sticking to one card, which shows planning and hypothesis formation. The realization that the strategy needed to change due to the algorithm shift shows adaptive thinking, justifying higher scores.
- **Evaluation**: The participant reflected on the effectiveness of their strategy by recognizing the need for change when the algorithm shifted, indicating a good level of self-evaluation. This insight into the strategy's effectiveness supports a higher score.
- **Final Decision**: The participant described a clear shift in strategy based on their evaluation, indicating a consistent rule or decision strategy was ultimately applied. The reflection suggests a thoughtful decision-making process.
- **Confidence**: The participant expressed a level of certainty in their approach by initially sticking to one strategy and then confidently switching strategies. This shows self-assurance in their understanding and decisions, warranting higher scores in confidence."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant's response indicates a rudimentary understanding of the task, as they recognized the need to make a choice that would benefit them. However, there is no clear indication that they understood the rules or structure beyond that, hence a higher probability for a score of 1.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy was to ""guess"" which option would be most beneficial, showing some level of planning or hypothesis formation, albeit very basic. This is why the score leans heavily towards 2.
- **Evaluation**: There is no evidence in the reflection that the participant evaluated the effectiveness of their strategy or considered why it worked or didn't work. Thus, the score is heavily weighted towards 0.
- **Final Decision**: The participant did not describe a consistent rule or decision strategy beyond initial guessing. The response suggests a lack of strategic refinement or adaptation, leading to a high probability for a score of 2.
- **Confidence**: The participant's use of ""just tried to guess"" implies a high level of uncertainty about their approach, suggesting low confidence in their strategy. However, the clarity and decisiveness in their statement (""no; I just tried to guess"") paradoxically reflect a strong confidence in their own admission of guessing, hence a higher score towards 4."

**Rationale:**
- **Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task's mechanics (switching based on performance), but lacks depth in explaining the rules or goals. The response suggests an adequate grasp but not a sophisticated understanding, hence a higher probability towards the middle scores.
- **Judgment:** The participant indicates a simple strategy of following the high scorer and switching when performance drops. This shows some planning but lacks depth or a sophisticated approach to strategy formulation, leading to a higher probability in the middle range.
- **Evaluation:** The participant's reflection on strategy effectiveness is minimal and lacks depth. They did not elaborate on why they thought the strategy worked or didn't, leading to a higher score in the lower range.
- **Final Decision:** The participant seems to have stuck to a consistent rule of following the high scorer and switching on low scores. This shows some decision consistency, hence a higher score towards the upper middle.
- **Confidence:** The participant does not express strong certainty or doubt about their approach; the use of a casual tone (""; No"") suggests a lack of deep confidence or reflection on their understanding, leading to a higher probability in the lower scores."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant seems to have a basic understanding of the task as they mention sticking with their ""original partner,"" which implies some grasp of the task's structure involving choices (partners). However, the depth of understanding isn't fully clear, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of sticking with the original choice suggests a planned approach, albeit a simple one. The reflection lacks detailed reasoning behind the choice, but the existence of a strategy is apparent, leading to a higher score in ""Good.""

**Evaluation:** The participant's brief mention of ""bad days"" hints at some reflection on the performance of their choice, suggesting they considered the variability in outcomes. However, the evaluation is not deeply explored, leading to a higher probability in ""Adequate.""

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states they did not switch strategies, indicating a consistent decision-making approach. The reflection, though brief, supports a higher score in ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"" due to the clarity and consistency in their final decision-making process.

**Confidence:** The participant's response lacks explicit statements about their confidence level, but the decision to stick with the original choice without switching suggests a level of confidence in their strategy. This interpretation leads to a higher score in ""Good"" and ""Exemplary,"" reflecting a presumed confidence in their approach."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant seems to understand the basic mechanics of the task, as indicated by their strategy of scouting for +100 and checking for changes to -50. However, the reflection lacks depth in explaining the overall goal or structure beyond immediate responses to outcomes, hence a higher probability for scores 2 and 3.

**Judgment:**  
The participant clearly outlines a plan of action (scouting for +100, rolling until a change occurs, and rechecking), which shows a formulated hypothesis about how to proceed. This indicates a good level of judgment, leaning towards scores 3 and 4.

**Evaluation:**  
The participant does reflect on the outcome of their strategy by checking if the -50 persists, but there is minimal insight into why they believe this strategy works or fails, which suggests a score leaning towards 2 and 3.

**Final Decision:**  
The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (scouting and rechecking based on specific outcomes), which is fairly clear and indicates a good understanding of a decision-making process. This suggests a higher score, leaning towards 3 and 4.

**Confidence:**  
The participant's brief and straightforward response, without expressing doubt or uncertainty about their strategy, implies a level of confidence. The lack of questioning or alternative considerations suggests a higher confidence score, leaning towards 3 and 4."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows an understanding of the task's basic goal (to get 100s), indicating some comprehension. However, the response lacks depth about the structure or rules beyond the outcomes, hence the highest probability at a score of 2.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of following rewards and switching upon their cessation suggests a clear plan, though not sophisticated. The response leans towards a good understanding of how to approach the task, reflected in a higher probability for a score of 3.

**Evaluation:** The participant briefly mentions switching strategies when the previous one stopped working, indicating some reflection on the strategy's effectiveness. However, the evaluation is not detailed or thorough, leading to a higher probability at a score of 2.

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response suggests a basic understanding of the task's feedback mechanism (""continued until I got a negative""), indicating some grasp of the task rules. However, the depth of understanding is not fully clear, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.

**Judgment:** The participant seems to have formed a basic plan (to continue until receiving negative feedback), but the strategy is not sophisticated or well-explained. This warrants a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score, with some chance for ""Rudimentary"" due to the lack of detail.

**Evaluation:** The reflection lacks any substantive evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness or reasoning behind its success or failure, leading to a high probability for an ""Absent"" score.

**Final Decision:** The participant mentions a decision rule (to stop after a negative outcome), but it's not clear if this was consistently applied or thoughtfully chosen. This ambiguity results in a split between ""Rudimentary"" and ""Adequate.""

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and vague response does not convey any strong sense of certainty or doubt about their strategy or understanding of the task, suggesting a high probability for an ""Absent"" score in confidence."

Rationale: The participant's reflection is extremely brief and lacks depth across all dimensions. 

- **Comprehension**: The participant's understanding of the task is questionable as the response is unclear and does not directly address the task's rules, structure, or goals. The mention of ""switching partners"" suggests a misunderstanding or miscommunication about the task itself, which was about probabilistic reversal learning, not about partners. A high probability is given to a score of 0, indicating an absence of comprehension.

- **Judgment**: The participant mentions a strategy of switching based on a ""negative number,"" which might indicate some form of hypothesis or plan. However, the context and relevance of this strategy are unclear, and it does not seem well thought out or relevant to the task described. A high probability is given to a score of 0, with a slight chance for a score of 1, acknowledging the attempt to form a plan.

- **Evaluation**: There is no reflection on whether the strategy worked or why, which would be critical for scoring higher in this dimension. The response lacks any evaluative comments, leading to a high probability of a score of 0.

- **Final Decision**: The participant does not describe a consistent rule or decision strategy that they ultimately applied, other than a vague reference to a negative number. This does not align well with the task's requirements, leading to a high probability of a score of 0.

- **Confidence**: The participant does not express any certainty or doubt about their approach or understanding. The semicolon and the ""No"" at the end of the response add to the confusion rather than clarify their level of confidence. A high probability is given to a score of 0, with a slight chance for a score of 1, acknowledging the possibility of implicit confidence in their misunderstood strategy.

Overall, the participant's reflection lacks depth and clarity, resulting in low scores across all dimensions."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant's response indicates a basic understanding of the task's goal (to gain points), but lacks depth in explaining the structure or rules. The probability leans towards ""Adequate"" as they understood the point-gaining aspect, which is central to the task.
- **Judgment**: The participant formed a basic plan (shifting to options that gained points), showing some judgment. The probabilities suggest a ""Good"" understanding as they had a clear, albeit simple, plan.
- **Evaluation**: The participant did not reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy beyond a simple acknowledgment of following points, showing a lack of deeper evaluation. The high probability for ""Absent"" reflects this lack.
- **Final Decision**: The participant stuck to a consistent rule (following the points), which is somewhat articulated. The probabilities lean towards ""Good"" and ""Exemplary"" as they clearly followed this rule throughout.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief and straightforward response, without expressing any doubt, suggests a high level of confidence in their approach, even if the strategy was simple. The high probability for ""Exemplary"" reflects strong confidence in their chosen method."

**Rationale:**
- **Comprehension:** The participant's response ""no. simply wild guess ; no"" suggests a lack of understanding or engagement with the task's rules or goals. The response is minimal and does not indicate any comprehension of the task structure, hence a high probability for a score of 1.
- **Judgment:** The participant indicates no strategic planning or hypothesis formation about how to act within the task, as they describe their approach as a ""wild guess."" This reflects a rudimentary level of judgment, leading to a high probability for a score of 1.
- **Evaluation:** The participant does not reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy or provide reasons for their actions beyond acknowledging their approach as guessing. This suggests minimal evaluation, supporting a high probability for a score of 1.
- **Final Decision:** The participant does not describe any consistent rule or decision strategy, merely indicating randomness in their choices. This supports a high probability for a score of 1.
- **Confidence:** The participant's brief and dismissive response, particularly the repeated ""no"" and the term ""simply wild guess,"" paradoxically indicates a high level of confidence in their understanding of their own approach, albeit a non-strategic one. This suggests a high probability for a score of 4, as they are certain about their lack of strategy."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a good understanding of the task's structure and goals by recognizing the performance trends of different partners and adjusting their choices accordingly. The response indicates a clear grasp of the task rules but lacks a detailed explanation of the task structure, hence the distribution leaning towards a higher score but not the highest.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a hypothesis based on the observed performance of the partners, indicating a strategic approach to decision-making. The reflection shows a plan of action, shifting focus based on performance, which is a clear indication of judgment but not deeply detailed or sophisticated.

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by noting the shift in performance of Partner 3 and adjusting their choices accordingly. This shows a good level of self-assessment and understanding of strategy effectiveness, deserving a higher score.

**Final Decision:** The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy by initially choosing based on success rates and then adjusting as performance changed. This indicates a thoughtful and adaptive approach, meriting a score leaning towards the higher end.

**Confidence:** The participant expresses some level of certainty in their approach by clearly stating their observations and actions. However, there is a slight ambiguity in how confident they felt about the shifts between partners, reflected in the moderate scores."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's statement suggests a basic understanding of the task as they recognize that no strategies seemed effective. However, the lack of detail about the task's rules or goals limits a higher score. The probability distribution reflects some understanding but not in-depth.

**Judgment:** The participant's reflection implies a judgment was made about the effectiveness of strategies, albeit a negative one. The judgment that ""No strategies work well"" indicates some level of planning or hypothesis testing, though it's not sophisticated or detailed.

**Evaluation:** The participant did reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy, concluding that it did not work. This shows some evaluation but lacks depth or a detailed analysis of why strategies failed, which prevents a higher score.

**Final Decision:** The participant seems to have decided that no strategies are effective, which is a form of decision strategy, albeit a negative one. This shows some consistency in their approach, but it's not a complex or proactive strategy.

**Confidence:** The participant's repeated assertion that no strategies work suggests a high level of confidence in their evaluation, despite it being a negative conclusion. The high scores in confidence reflect this strong belief in their assessment of the task's strategy effectiveness."

- **Comprehension**: The participant's response suggests a minimal understanding of the task as they mention choosing ""randomly"" and being ""full focused,"" but does not explicitly indicate an understanding of the task rules or goals. The high probability for a score of 0 reflects the lack of clear comprehension expressed.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of random choice indicates a rudimentary form of judgment without a structured plan or hypothesis about how to act, justifying a higher probability for lower scores.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not reflect on whether their strategy worked or why, which suggests a lack of evaluation. The high probability for a score of 0 reflects this absence.
- **Final Decision**: The mention of randomness suggests some consistency in their approach (albeit a non-strategic one), but it's not clear or sophisticated, leading to a higher probability for lower scores.
- **Confidence**: The participant expresses some level of engagement and focus, which might indicate a degree of confidence in their approach, albeit not in a strategic sense. This justifies a mixed but low scoring."

- **Comprehension**: The participant's response suggests a basic understanding of the task as they attempted to identify a ""hot streak."" However, the response lacks depth or detailed understanding of the task's structure or rules, hence the higher probabilities for scores 1 and 2.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy to ""figure out where the hot streak was"" indicates some form of planning or hypothesis, but it's quite rudimentary and not well articulated. This justifies the higher probabilities for scores 1 and 2.
- **Evaluation**: The participant did not reflect on whether their strategy worked or why, as indicated by their brief response and the explicit ""no"" to strategy switching. This suggests a lack of evaluation, leading to a high probability for a score of 0.
- **Final Decision**: The participant's strategy seems to be consistent (""just tried to figure out where the hot streak was"") but is not well-defined or sophisticated. This leads to a balanced probability across scores 1 and 2.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief and somewhat dismissive response (""not really, just tried...; no"") suggests a low level of confidence in their approach or understanding of the task, hence the high probability for a score of 0."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows an understanding of the task's feedback mechanism (negative responses) and adjusts behavior based on it. The response indicates a basic grasp of the task rules but lacks depth in explaining the structure or goal beyond reacting to negative feedback. Hence, a higher probability is given to an ""Adequate"" score.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of switching decks based on the frequency of negative responses shows some planning and hypothesis formation (anticipating better outcomes by switching). The clarity and thoughtfulness in this approach suggest a higher score towards ""Good.""

**Evaluation:** The participant reflects on the effectiveness of their strategy by monitoring the frequency of negative responses, which indicates some evaluation. However, the depth of this reflection is not fully comprehensive, leaning more towards a ""Good"" score.

**Final Decision:** The participant clearly states a consistent rule they applied (switching decks upon receiving too many negative responses), which is a direct and straightforward strategy. This decision-making process is well-articulated, justifying a higher score towards ""Exemplary.""

**Confidence:** The participant does not explicitly express confidence or doubt about their strategy. The statement is somewhat neutral, suggesting they followed a rule without questioning its validity deeply. This leads to a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score, with some possibility of ""Good"" due to the absence of expressed uncertainty."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant indicates a basic understanding of the task by mentioning they were ""looking for patterns in the correct colors."" This suggests some grasp of the task's goal, but the response lacks depth or detail about the structure or rules, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.

**Judgment:** The participant's strategy of looking for patterns shows some form of hypothesis or plan formation. However, the simplicity of the statement and lack of detail about how they applied this strategy suggests a stronger leaning towards a ""Good"" score, with a small chance for ""Exemplary"" due to the direct mention of a strategy.

**Evaluation:** The participant does not reflect on whether their strategy worked or why, as indicated by the terse response and absence of any evaluative statements. This dimension scores highly towards ""Absent.""

**Final Decision:** The participant's statement about not switching strategies suggests a consistent rule or decision strategy was applied throughout the task. The clarity in this part of the response suggests a higher score, leaning towards ""Good"" or ""Exemplary.""

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and straightforward response, especially the clear ""No"" to changing strategies, indicates a level of certainty about their approach. This suggests confidence in their decision-making, warranting a higher score in this dimension."

**Rationale:**
- **Comprehension:** The participant's statement ""I just aimlessly guessed"" suggests a lack of understanding or engagement with the task rules or goals. This indicates a high probability of a low score, but there is a slight chance (0.2) that the participant understood the task but chose not to engage with it strategically.
- **Judgment:** The participant's admission of aimless guessing implies an absence of any strategic hypothesis or plan formation. This is almost entirely indicative of a score of 0, with a small probability (0.1) that there was minimal, albeit ineffective, judgment involved.
- **Evaluation:** The reflection lacks any indication that the participant evaluated the effectiveness of their strategy. The statement suggests no reflection on whether the strategy worked or why, leading to a high probability of a score of 0.
- **Final Decision:** The participant does not describe any consistent rule or decision strategy, other than random guessing. This suggests a high probability of a low score, with a slight chance (0.2) that guessing was their consistent decision strategy.
- **Confidence:** The participant's statement reflects some level of certainty about their approach (""I just aimlessly guessed""), which suggests a mix of scores. There is a moderate probability (0.4) for a score of 1, indicating rudimentary confidence, and some probability (0.3) for a score of 2, reflecting a clearer but not in-depth expression of their approach."

Rationale:
- **Comprehension**: The participant shows a basic understanding of sticking with a choice that performs well, indicating some grasp of the task's goal (to maximize outcomes). However, the reflection lacks depth about the structure or rules of the task, hence the higher probability for a score of 2.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of sticking with a ""worker"" until performance drops implies a plan or hypothesis was formed about how to act. The reflection suggests a moderate level of strategic thinking, leading to a higher score in judgment.
- **Evaluation**: The participant's reflection on the strategy's effectiveness is minimal and vague (""until they weren't""), indicating some level of evaluation but not deeply insightful or thorough. This results in a higher probability for a score of 2.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule or decision strategy (staying with a choice until it fails), which is somewhat clear but not detailed or justified with deep reasoning. This leads to a higher score in this dimension.
- **Confidence**: The participant does not express strong certainty or doubt about their approach; the response is somewhat indifferent (""No"" to strategy change). This suggests a middling level of confidence, leaning towards uncertainty, hence a higher score of 2."

- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy of choosing the middle option indicates a basic plan or hypothesis but lacks sophistication or detailed reasoning. The probabilities lean towards a rudimentary to adequate judgment.
- **Evaluation**: The participant did not reflect on whether their strategy was effective or why it might have worked or failed, leading to a high probability of scoring low in this dimension.
- **Final Decision**: The statement about sticking mostly to the middle option suggests a consistent rule or decision strategy, albeit not very sophisticated. The probabilities are higher for good and exemplary because the participant did stick to a clear, though simple, strategy.
- **Confidence**: The participant's brief and casual response (""mostly"") and the flat denial of strategy switching (""No"") suggest some level of uncertainty or lack of deep confidence in their approach. The probabilities are distributed to reflect this uncertainty."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant shows a basic understanding of the task by recognizing that they should click on ""higher ones"" until a change occurs. However, the explanation lacks depth about the overall goal or structure of the task, suggesting a score leaning towards ""Adequate"" but not fully clear or comprehensive.

**Judgment:** The participant indicates a strategy of selecting higher values, which reflects some form of planning or hypothesis. However, the strategy is not elaborated upon, and there's no indication of adaptive planning or deeper strategic thinking, leading to a score that leans towards ""Adequate.""

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection lacks any substantive evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness beyond a simple acknowledgment of a change (""till it turn negative""). This suggests a high probability for a lower score as there is minimal reflection on the strategy's success or reasons for outcomes.

**Final Decision:** The participant seems to have stuck with a single strategy throughout the task, as indicated by the brief and direct ""no"" in response to whether they switched strategies. This suggests some consistency in their decision-making, warranting a score around ""Adequate"" to ""Good.""

**Confidence:** The participant's confidence in their strategy or understanding of the task is not explicitly mentioned. The terse response and lack of depth in their reflection suggest uncertainty or minimal self-assurance, leading to a score that leans towards ""Adequate."""

- **Judgment**: The participant indicates a basic strategy (""moved on if the partner turned on me""), which shows some plan of action but lacks sophistication or detailed reasoning. Therefore, a high probability is assigned to a score of 2.
- **Evaluation**: There is no reflection on the effectiveness or outcomes of the strategy used, leading to a high probability of scoring 0.
- **Final Decision**: The participant describes a consistent rule (""moved on if the partner turned on me""), but it's a simple strategy without much elaboration or justification. Thus, a high probability is given to a score of 2.
- **Confidence**: The participant's response does not explicitly express certainty or doubt about their strategy, but the terse and straightforward nature of the response suggests a lack of reflective confidence. Therefore, a high probability is assigned to a score of 1."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:**  
The participant shows some understanding of the task rules by indicating a response to failure (""after two times they failed""). This suggests a basic grasp of the task's trial-and-error nature. The probabilities reflect a moderate understanding, leaning towards good, as the participant recognizes the need to adapt based on outcomes.

**Judgment:**  
The participant's strategy formulation (""I tried a different person"") indicates a plan to change tactics upon repeated failure, which is a clear judgment call. The higher probabilities for scores 3 and 2 suggest that the participant had a clear but not deeply sophisticated plan.

**Evaluation:**  
The reflection includes a minimal evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness, implied by the decision to switch tactics after failure. The distribution leans towards an adequate evaluation, as the participant does not provide detailed reasoning or outcomes of the strategy shift.

**Final Decision:**  
The participant states a clear decision rule for changing strategies (""Yes if after two times they failed"") and also mentions sticking to the same strategy, which might indicate some confusion or contradiction. The probabilities favor a good final decision-making process, acknowledging some clarity in their approach.

**Confidence:**  
Confidence is somewhat implied through the participant's straightforward statement of their strategy, though not explicitly expressed. The higher probabilities for scores 3 and 2 suggest a moderate level of confidence in their approach, with some room for doubt as no strong, assertive language is used."

**Rationale:**

**Comprehension:** The participant's response suggests a rudimentary understanding of the task's mechanics (""click until they let me down twice""), indicating they grasped the basic idea of a trial-and-error approach but lacked depth in understanding the full structure or goal of the task. The probability leans heavily towards a rudimentary score.

**Judgment:** The participant formed a basic plan or hypothesis about how to act, as indicated by their strategy of continuing to choose an option until it fails twice. This shows some clarity in planning but lacks depth, hence a higher probability for an ""Adequate"" score.

**Evaluation:** The participant's reflection lacks any substantive evaluation of whether their strategy was effective or why it might have been so. They did not reflect on the outcomes or adapt their strategy based on performance, leading to a high probability of an ""Absent"" score.

**Final Decision:** The participant described a consistent rule or decision strategy (""click until they let me down twice""), which they seemed to apply throughout the task without change. This indicates a clear decision strategy, meriting a higher score in this dimension.

**Confidence:** The participant's brief and direct response (""no"") when asked if they switched strategies suggests a high level of confidence in their chosen approach, despite its simplicity. This warrants a high probability for an ""Exemplary"" score in confidence, as they showed no doubt about their understanding or strategy."

Rationale:  
- **Comprehension**: The participant's response indicates a rudimentary understanding of the task's goal (identifying the option that yields 100 points). However, the response lacks depth or a clear explanation of the task structure or rules, suggesting a score leaning towards rudimentary but with some possibility of adequate understanding.
- **Judgment**: The participant's strategy (""just tried to see who would give 100 points"") suggests a basic plan was formed, but it lacks sophistication or detailed planning. The response shows some judgment but not a well-developed hypothesis.
- **Evaluation**: The participant does not reflect on the effectiveness of their strategy or why it might have worked or failed, leading to a high probability of an absent score in this dimension.
- **Final Decision**: The participant's strategy description is vague and does not indicate a consistent rule or decision strategy applied throughout the task. The response suggests a higher probability for rudimentary or adequate, with less likelihood for a good or exemplary score.
- **Confidence**: The participant's response does not clearly express certainty or doubt about their approach. The use of a simple statement without further elaboration suggests some level of uncertainty, leading to a distribution across lower scores."
